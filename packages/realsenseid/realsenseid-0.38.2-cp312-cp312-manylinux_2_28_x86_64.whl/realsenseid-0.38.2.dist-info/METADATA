# Intel® RealSense™ ID Python SDK

Intel RealSense ID is your trusted facial authentication on-device solution.

Intel RealSense ID combines an active depth sensor with a specialized neural network designed to deliver an intuitive, secure and accurate facial authentication solution that adapts over time. This solution offers user privacy and is activated by user awareness. Built-in anti spoofing technology protects against attacks using photographs, videos or masks.

Intel RealSense ID is a natural solution simplifying secure entry for everyone, everywhere. Supports children to tall adults and designed for Smart Locks, Access Control, PoS, ATMs, and Kiosks.

Developer kits containing the necessary hardware to use this library are available for purchase at store.intelrealsense.com. See information about the Intel RealSense ID technology at https://www.intelrealsense.com/facial-authentication/

For high-level architecture, see Intel RealSense ID F450 / F455 Architecture Diagram.

Note: Device = Intel RealSense ID F450 / F455



## Installation

You should install the version that matches the firmware version currently running on the device. Please refer to the RealSenseID releases page:
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/RealSenseID/releases 

```
pip install realsenseid==<version>
```

### Code samples

For a full listing of samples, please refer to: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/RealSenseID/tree/master/samples/python

Authentication:

```python
import rsid_py

PORT='COM9'

def on_result(result, user_id):
    print('on_result', result)    
    if result == rsid_py.AuthenticateStatus.Success:
        print('Authenticated user:', user_id)

def on_faces(faces, timestamp):    
    print(f'detected {len(faces)} face(s)')
    for f in faces:
        print(f'\tface {f.x},{f.y} {f.w}x{f.h}')    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with rsid_py.FaceAuthenticator(PORT) as f:
        f.authenticate(on_faces=on_faces, on_result=on_result)
```

User Enrollment:

```python
import rsid_py

PORT='COM9'

def on_result(result):
    print('on_result', result)    

def on_progress(p):    
    print(f'on_progress {p}')

def on_hint(h):    
    print(f'on_hint {h}')

def on_faces(faces, timestamp):    
    print(f'detected {len(faces)} face(s)')
    for f in faces:
        print(f'\tface {f.x},{f.y} {f.w}x{f.h}')    


if __name__ == '__main__':
    with rsid_py.FaceAuthenticator(PORT) as f:
        user_id = input("User id to enroll: ")
        f.enroll(user_id=user_id, on_hint=on_hint, on_progress=on_progress, on_faces=on_faces, on_result=on_result)

        #display list of enrolled users
        users = f.query_user_ids()
        print('Users: ', users)
```

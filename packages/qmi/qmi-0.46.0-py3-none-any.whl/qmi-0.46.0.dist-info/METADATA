# Quantum Measurement Infrastructure

QMI is a Python 3 framework for controlling laboratory equipment. It is suitable for anything ranging from one-off
scientific experiments to robust operational setups.

QMI is developed by [QuTech](https://qutech.nl) to support advanced physics experiments involving quantum bits.
However, other than its name and original purpose, there is nothing specifically *quantum* about QMI â€” it is potentially
useful in any environment where monitoring and control of measurement equipment is needed.

## Dependencies
The full functioning of this software is dependent on several external Python packages, dynamic libraries and drivers.
The following items are not delivered as part of this software and must be acquired and installed by the user separately,
when necessary for the use of a specific QMI driver:

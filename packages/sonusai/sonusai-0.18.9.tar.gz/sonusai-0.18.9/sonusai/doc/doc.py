Optional fields:

 'truth_settings'
                Local overrides for truth. Contains any or all of the
                following:

  'function'    Name of truth function <str>
  'config'      Truth function config <dict>
  'index'       Truth index <int> or list(<int>)

                'index' indicates which truth fields should be set.
                0 indicates none, 1 is first element in truth output
                vector, 2 2nd element, etc.

                Examples:
                  index = 5       truth in class 5, truth(4, 1)
                  index = [1, 5]  truth in classes 1 and 5, truth([0, 4], 1)

                In mutually-exclusive mode, a frame is expected to only
                belong to one class and thus all probabilities must sum to
                1, and there should be a class for "other" or "none". This
                is effectively truth for a classifier with multichannel
                softmax output. SonusAI will automatically calculate class
                num_classes as 1 - sum(truth(1:num_classes-1). For
                example, a classifier for (dog, cat) must have
                num_classes=3 to include "none" in truth(3).

                For multi-label classification each class is an individual
                probability for that class and any given frame can be
                assigned to multiple classes/labels, i.e., the classes are
                not mutually-exclusive. For example, a NN classifier with
                multichannel sigmoid output. In this case, index could
                also be a vector with multiple class indices. num_classes
                should be set to the number of classes/categories.

  'class_balancing_augmentation'
                Target-specific class balancing augmentation override.
                This target will not use the global class balancing
                augmentation rule, but will use this rule instead for
                class balancing operations. If this rule is specified and
                empty, then this target will not be used for class
                balancing.

    return """
'truth_settings' is a mixture database configuration parameter that sets the truth
generation settings for targets. There is a global 'truth_settings' and there may be
target-specific 'truth_settings'.

A truth setting creates a type of truth and is associated with target file(s).
Target files may have multiple truth settings.
Truth may be non-temporal, per sample, or per feature frame and each value may be scalar
or vector.

Note that there is a difference between transform frames and feature frames: a feature
frame can potentially have a stride dimension (which aggregates multiple transform
frames in a single feature).

There are two notions of truth data: truth_t and truth_f. truth_t is what the truth
functions always generate and it is in the time domain. truth_f, or truth in the feature
domain, is created from truth_t in the following manner. First, the
'truth_reduction_function' specified by the config reduces truth_t into truth data in
the transform frame domain. Then, this transform frame domain truth data is passed
into the feature generator which produces feature frame domain truth data. 

The 'truth_settings' parameter specifies the following:

 'function'     Name of truth function
 'config'       Truth function specific config dictionary
 'index'        Truth index is either a single int or a list of ints

                'index' indicates which truth fields should be set.
                0 indicates none, 1 is the first element in the truth output
                vector, 2 is the 2nd element, etc.

                Examples:
                  index = 5       truth in class 5, truth(4, 1)
                  index = [1, 5]  truth in classes 1 and 5, truth([0, 4], 1)

                In mutually-exclusive mode, a frame is expected to only
                belong to one class and thus all probabilities must sum to
                1, and there should be a class for "other" or "none". This
                is effectively truth for a classifier with multichannel
                softmax output. SonusAI will automatically calculate class
                num_classes as 1 - sum(truth(1:num_classes-1). For
                example, a classifier for (dog, cat) must have
                num_classes=3 to include "none" in truth(3).

                For multi-label classification each class is an individual
                probability for that class and any given frame can be
                assigned to multiple classes/labels, i.e., the classes are
                not mutually-exclusive. For example, a NN classifier with
                multichannel sigmoid output. In this case, index could
                also be a vector with multiple class indices. num_classes

Augmentation Rules

These rules may be specified for target and/or noise. Each rule will be
applied for each target/noise. The values may be specified as scalars, lists,
or random using the syntax: 'rand(<min>, <max>)'.

If a value is specified as a list, then the rule is repeated for each value in
the list.

If a value is specified using rand, then a randomized rule is generated
dynamically per use.

Rules may specify any or all of the following augmentations:

 'normalize'    Normalize audio file to the specified level (in dBFS).
 'gain'         Apply an amplification or an attenuation to the audio signal.
                The signal level is adjusted by the given number of dB; positive
                amplifies, negative attenuates, 0 does nothing.
 'pitch'        Change the audio pitch (but not its tempo). Pitch amount is
                specified as positive or negative 'cents' (i.e., 100ths of a
                semitone).
 'tempo'        Change the audio tempo (but not its pitch). Tempo amount is
                specified as the ratio of the new tempo to the old tempo. For
                example, '1.1' speeds up the tempo by 10% and '0.9' slows it
                down by 10%.
 'eq1'          Apply a two-pole peaking equalization filter. EQ parameters are
                specified as a [frequency, width, gain] triple where:
                  'frequency' gives the central frequency in Hz (20 - SR/2),
                  'width' gives the width as a Q-factor (0.3 - 2.0), and
                  'gain' gives the gain in dB (-20 - 20).
 'eq2'          Apply an additional band of EQ. Same as 'eq1'
 'eq3'          Apply an additional band of EQ. Same as 'eq1'
 'lpf'          Apply a low-pass Butterworth filter. The 3 dB point frequency is
                specified in Hz (20 - SR/2).
 'ir'           An index into a list of impulse responses (specified in the
                'impulse_responses' parameter).
                For targets, the impulse response is applied AFTER truth generation
                and the resulting audio is still aligned with the truth. Random
                syntax for 'ir' is simply 'rand' (i.e., do not specify <min> and <max>).

Only the specified augmentations for a given rule are applied; all others are
skipped in the given rule. For example, if a rule only specifies 'tempo',
then only a tempo augmentation is applied and all other possible augmentations
are ignored (e.g., 'gain', 'pitch', etc.).

Example:

target_augmentations:
  - normalize: -3.5
  - normalize: -3.5
    pitch: [-300, 300]
    tempo: [0.8, 1.2]
    eq1: [[1000, 0.8, 3], [600, 1.0, -4], [800, 0.6, 0]]
  - normalize: -3.5
    pitch: "rand(-300, 300)"
    eq1: ["rand(100, 6000)", "rand(0.6, 1.0)", "rand(-6, 6)"]
    lpf: "rand(1000, 8000)"
  - tempo: "rand(0.9, 1.1)"
    eq1: [["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, -10], ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, 10]]

There are four rules given in this example.

The first rule is simple:
  - normalize: -3.5

This results in just one augmentation being applied to each target:

  normalize: -3.5

The second rule illustrates the use of lists to specify values:
  - normalize: -3.5
    pitch: [-300, 300]
    tempo: [0.8, 1.2]
    eq1: [[1000, 0.8, 3], [600, 1.0, -4], [800, 0.6, 0]]

There are two values given for pitch, two for tempo, and three for EQ. This
rule expands to 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 unique augmentations being applied to each
target:

  normalize: -3.5, pitch: -3, tempo: 0.8, eq1: [1000, 0.8,  3]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch: -3, tempo: 0.8, eq1: [ 600, 1.0, -4]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch: -3, tempo: 0.8, eq1: [ 800, 0.6,  0]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch: -3, tempo: 1.2, eq1: [1000, 0.8,  3]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch: -3, tempo: 1.2, eq1: [ 600, 1.0, -4]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch: -3, tempo: 1.2, eq1: [ 800, 0.6,  0]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch:  3, tempo: 0.8, eq1: [1000, 0.8,  3]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch:  3, tempo: 0.8, eq1: [ 600, 1.0, -4]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch:  3, tempo: 0.8, eq1: [ 800, 0.6,  0]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch:  3, tempo: 1.2, eq1: [1000, 0.8,  3]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch:  3, tempo: 1.2, eq1: [ 600, 1.0, -4]
  normalize: -3.5, pitch:  3, tempo: 1.2, eq1: [ 800, 0.6,  0]

The third rule shows the use of rand:
  - normalize: -3.5
    pitch: "rand(-300, 300)"
    eq1: ["rand(100, 6000)", "rand(0.6, 1.0)", "rand(-6, 6)"]
    lpf: "rand(1000, 8000)"

This rule is used to create randomized augmentations per use.

The fourth rule demonstrates the use of scalars, lists, and rand:
  - tempo: [0.9, 1, 1.1]
    eq1: [["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, -10], ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, 10]]

This rule expands to 6 unique augmentations being applied to each target
(list of 3 * list of 2). Here is the expansion:

  tempo: 0.9, eq1: ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, -10]
  tempo: 1.0, eq1: ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, -10]
  tempo: 1.1, eq1: ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, -10]
  tempo: 0.9, eq1: ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, 10]
  tempo: 1.0, eq1: ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, 10]
  tempo: 1.1, eq1: ["rand(100, 7500)", 0.8, 10]"""

                    tiny.en, tiny, base.en, base, small.en, small, medium.en, medium, large-v1, large-v2, large
 'device'       Some ASR engines allow the specification of a device, either 'cpu' or 'cuda'.
 'cpu_threads'  Some ASR engines allow the specification of the number of CPU threads to use.
 'compute_type' Some ASR engines allow the specification of a compute type, e.g. 'int8'.
 'beam_size'    Some ASR engines allow the specification of a beam size.
 <other>        Other parameters can be injected into the ASR engine as needed; all
                fields in each config are forwarded to the given engine.

Example:

asr_configs:
  - name: faster_tiny_cuda
    engine: faster_whisper
    model: tiny
    device: cuda
    beam_size: 5
  - name: google
    engine: google

Creates two ASR engines for use named faster_tiny_cuda and google.

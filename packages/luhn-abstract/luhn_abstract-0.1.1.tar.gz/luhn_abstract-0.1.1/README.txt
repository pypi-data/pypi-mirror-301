**luhn_abstract** is a Python module for automatically generating an abstract from a document using unsupervised techniques.  The Luhn paper was published in 1958, and the general concept of the algorithm is outlined in the diagram below.

Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, 
on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach:  Although 
rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they 
have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023. [22.5000] [8] In 
2003, word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, was 
outperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and 
context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a 
CPU cluster in language modelling) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors. [18.0000] 
The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room 
experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with 
questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language 
understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it 
confronts. [17.4222] As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to 
build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective 
of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[50] 
with two defining aspects: Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the 
historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since 
the statistical turn during the 1990s. [16.2881]

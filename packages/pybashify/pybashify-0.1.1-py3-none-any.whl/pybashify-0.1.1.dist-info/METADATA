           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# pybashify

Ever wanted to use bash scripts but they look like a bunch of mumbo jumbo?
You may have tried the python versions, but they aren't practical when you actually want to run bash, but it's a pain in the neck to actually write that.

That's where pybashify comes in:
It allows you to write bash scripts using python whilst **compiling** them to bash using a template syntax within a bash script that follows the same conventions as regular bash.

In other words, you get to seamlessly interop bash and python! Offload the more complex portions to python, while letting bash do the simple things.

Think of this like a bash template to full bash script compilation that occurs.

And ALL the bash code you write with the template syntax is not only COMPLETELY VALID bash scripting BY ITSELF (which means now you can test just the bash portion without running the python portion; also gives a good separation of concerns at times) but now you are able to write much cleaner code to host on a curl link!

Oh and another side effect of the fact that templates are 100% valid bash: your editor has syntax highlighting for this!

### Wait, so you're hijacking existing bash features and repurposing them to work for interoperating with Python scripts?

Yes. It's not that bad though, since the features it repurposes are features that nobody uses in bash anyway, such as the `declare` keyword.
And even if it were to matter, you have CLI options to mitigate this.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pybashify
```

### Building from source

```bash
pixi run build
```

## Usage

First, create a bash script. This will serve as your template for the real bash script that you will generate.

Then, in the bash script, at its simplest level, you can do this (I'm putting a few variations):
```bash
declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE="my.python.module"
```

```bash
declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE='my.python.module'
```

```bash
declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE=my.python.module
```

```bash
declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE = "my.python.module"
```

...you get the idea.

Then, you can run:


```bash
bashify template.sh [--out full_script.sh] [--compat] [--compat-prefix="PY"]
```

And NOW, a new shell script should be generated with all the same things your original had, except now the area where BASHIFY_EXECUTE was is now replaced with the execution of said python code. This is VERY useful for having users `curl`.

### But wait, there's more!


The example above is functionally equivalent to:

```bash
declare my.python.module

declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE
```

Now why are there 2 ways to do this? Because you can do this:

```bash
declare my.python.module
declare my.other.python.module

declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE
```

This will execute BOTH modules back-to-back inside `BASHIFY_EXECUTE`. And yes that means order matters. `my.python.module` will be executed first, followed by `my.other.python.module`.

You can have the declarations wherever you want, as long as they follow a specific order. However, the position of `BASHIFY_EXECUTE` DOES matter as that will be where they ultimately aggregate.

### This is cool, but I don't like shell features being hijacked

Well you're in luck!

What you need to do to mitigate this is run:
```bash
bashify my_script.sh --compat
```

and then in your `my_script.sh`, you would do:

```bash
declare PY.BASHIFY_EXECUTE=my.python.module
```

or

```bash
declare PY.my.python.module
declare PY.BASHIFY_EXECUTE
```

Obviously, you can also modify the prefix with the `--compat-prefix` flag.

### Compiled Outputs

You can just have your template be `my_script.template.sh` and if you run it without specifying an output, it will have the compiled version be `my_script.sh`.
If you do not use this notation and still go default without specifying an output script, it will by default do `my_script_template-compiled.sh` if your script input was `my_script_template.sh`.

Alright, I'm done yapping. Have a nice day, remember to stay hydrated, and definitely remember that I use blendOS btw :smiling_imp: :fire: :100:

## Raw Reference

Without compat mode:

- `declare` refers to a python module
- the name of the variable is the python module (in the same way you import my.python.module)
- there should not be a value
- order is inferred by the order in which your declares are. And yes you can mix them but it is not recommended
- aside from the order of the declares, the positioning of them in the file does not matter as they will be deleted in the compiled version
- The positioning of your final python script declaration, however, DOES matter.
- Use `declare BASHIFY_EXECUTE` for where you want to execute the Python code. However, as stated above, POSITIONING MATTERS
- Note that none of these `declare`s will work if they are on the same line separated with semicolons. might add that feature later if yall want but right now each `declare` requires its own line
- It should also be scoped globally (meaning that it can't be within an if statement)
- There can only be a single `BASHIFY_EXECUTE`. If there are multiple, it will default to the last one

With compat mode:

- Same as without compat mode except all `declare`s are prefixed with `compat_prefix`. By default, it is "PY", so you'd prefix like so: PY.my.python.module
- This ALSO applies to the execution directive. By default, it would be: `declare PY.BASHIFY_EXECUTE`
- This means that `declare` by default is not hijacked

Another Caveat:
- For system packages, you MUST do `import a.b.c` and not `from a.b import c`

## Compatibility with Python

3.10+ is required. Some features break when on 3.9


## Development

```bash
pixi install
pixi shell --change-ps1=false -e dev
```

Oh yeah, this project uses [pipelight](https://pipelight.dev) btw because I said so. It is used for pre-commit / push hooks while still being readable and maintainable.
You need to download that and Deno then you are good to go. Don't get scared of the deno stuff, this is just for a few things under the hood for logs in dev not prod. :fire:

### Publishing releases

In order to do this, I have standardized it via running this command:

```bash
scripts/update-version.sh
```

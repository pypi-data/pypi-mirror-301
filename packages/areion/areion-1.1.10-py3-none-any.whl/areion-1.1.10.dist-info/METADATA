Welcome to the Areion HTTP Server documentation. Areion is a lightweight, asynchronous HTTP server written in Python, designed for simplicity and extensibility. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using Areion, covering everything from getting started to advanced usage and component details.

Areion supports asynchronous operations, multithreading, routing, orchestration, customizable loggers, and template engines. The framework provides an intuitive API for building web services, with components like the `Orchestrator`, `Router`, `Logger`, and `Engine` easily swappable or extendable.

We designed Areion to have as few dependencies as possible. We created our own HTTP server on top of asyncio's sockets. While we dream of being the fastest, most preferred Python web server, we know we have a long way to go. We are still in the early stages of development, and we welcome any feedback, contributions, or suggestions. The documentation below is likely to become outdated as we continue to migrate to v2.0.0 which will feature a whole documentation site with more examples, tutorials, and guides.

**Development Mode:** Add the flag `with_development_mode(True)` to the `AreionServerBuilder` to enable development mode. This mode will automatically add Swagger UI and OpenAPI routes to your server. They are accessible from the routes `/docs` and `/openapi` respectively.

## Benchmark

We conducted performance benchmarks to compare **Areion**, **FastAPI**, and **Flask**, focusing on throughput and latency under high-load conditions. The goal was to evaluate each framework's ability to handle concurrent connections efficiently and provide fast response times. We used the same JSON response in all frameworks to ensure a fair comparison.

### Benchmark Results

These show the results of running the benchmark test for 30 seconds with 12 threads and 400 connections on my local machine. The test was conducted using the `wrk` benchmarking tool. The results are summarized below, followed by detailed output for each framework.

#### Summary

| Framework | Requests/sec | Avg Latency (ms) | Transfer/sec | Total Requests | Socket Errors             |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Areion    | 47,241.97    | 8.46             | 4.42 MB      | 1,418,550      | Read: 545                 |
| FastAPI   | 3,579.10     | 111.53           | 531.27 KB    | 107,613        | Read: 419                 |

### Analysis

#### Throughput (Requests per Second)

- **Areion:** 47,241.97 requests/sec
- **FastAPI:** 3,579.10 requests/sec
- **Flask:** 555.98 requests/sec

Areion handled approximately 13 times more requests per second than FastAPI and 85 times more than Flask.

#### Average Latency

- **Areion:** 8.46 ms
- **Flask:** 47.45 ms
- **FastAPI:** 111.53 ms

Areion's average latency is about 5.6 times lower than Flask and 13 times lower than FastAPI, indicating faster response times.

#### Total Requests Handled

- **Areion:** 1,418,550 requests
- **FastAPI:** 107,613 requests
- **Flask:** 16,708 requests

Areion processed significantly more total requests during the test duration.

#### Socket Errors

- **Areion:** Read errors: 545
- **FastAPI:** Read errors: 419
- **Flask:** Connect errors: 74, Read errors: 36,245, Write errors: 125

For handling 10x the requests of FastAPI and 85x the requests of Flask, Areion had a relatively low number of socket errors.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Areion can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install areion
```

### Developing

To get started developing this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoshCap20/areion.git
```

2. Install the dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

### Quick Start Guide

Below is a simple example to get you started with Areion.

```python

from areion import AreionServerBuilder, DefaultRouter

# Initialize the router
router = DefaultRouter()

# Define a simple route
@router.route("/hello")
def hello_world(request):
    return "Hello, World!"

# Build and run the server
server = AreionServerBuilder().with_router(router).build()
server.run()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Router Initialization:** We create a Router instance to manage our routes.
- **Defining Routes:** Using the @router.route decorator, we define a route that responds to /hello.
- **Server Building:** We use AreionServerBuilder to construct the server with the router.
- **Running the Server:** The server.run() method starts the server synchronously.

### Development Tools

Development tools are essential to increasing development ease and efficiency. With this in mind, we also don't want to slow down the server in production. To enable development tools, add the `with_development_mode(True)` flag to the `AreionServerBuilder`.

**Development Tools:**

- **Swagger UI:** Provides an interactive API documentation interface.
- **OpenAPI Routes:** Exposes auto-generated OpenAPI schema and routes for API exploration.

**Coming Soon:**

- **Automatic Reload:** Automatically reloads the server on code changes.
- **Debugging Tools:** Built-in debugging tools for inspecting requests and responses.
- **Testing Tools:** Integration with testing frameworks for automated testing.
- **Security Tools:** Security checks and recommendations for your server.
- **Performance Tools:** Performance monitoring and optimization tools.

## Core Components

### AreionServer

The `AreionServer` is the main class that represents the server. It manages components such as the router, orchestrator, logger, and HTTP server.

**Key Features:**

- **Asynchronous Operation:** Built on top of asyncio for non-blocking operations.
- **Component Integration:** Integrates with router, orchestrator, and other components.
- **Static File Serving:** Supports serving static files.

_Do not initialize AreionServer directly unless you know what you're doing. Use AreionServerBuilder to create an instance which includes safeguards and defaults required for other components._

#### AreionServerBuilder

The `AreionServerBuilder` provides a fluent interface for constructing an AreionServer instance with the desired components and configurations.

**Only a router is required for a minimal server setup.**

**Example:**

```python
from areion import AreionServerBuilder, DefaultRouter, DefaultLogger, DefaultOrchestrator, DefaultEngine

router = DefaultRouter()
logger = DefaultLogger()
orchestrator = DefaultOrchestrator()
engine = DefaultEngine()

server = AreionServerBuilder().with_router(router).with_logger(logger).with_orchestrator(orchestrator).with_port(8080).with_engine(engine).with_static_dir("static").build()
```

### Router

The `Router` class manages URL routes and their corresponding handlers. If no methods are defined, it defaults to only accepting GET requests. You can define middleware at the route, route group, or global level.

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Routing:** Supports dynamic path segments (e.g., /user/:id).
- **Method Specification:** Handlers can specify allowed HTTP methods.
- **Middleware Support:** Allows adding global and route-specific middleware.

**Usage:**

```python
from areion import DefaultRouter

router = DefaultRouter()

# Adding a route with a dynamic segment
@router.route("/user/:id", methods=["GET"])
def get_user(request, id):
    return f"User ID: {id}"

# Adding global middleware
def log_request(handler):
    def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Received request: {request.path}")
        return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

router.add_global_middleware(log_request)
```

You can also use a Django-like syntax for defining routes:

```python
router = DefaultRouter()

def get_user(request, id):
    return f"User ID: {id}"

router.add_route("/user/:id", get_user, methods=["GET"])
```

Route with middleware:

```python
router = DefaultRouter()

def get_user(request, id):
    return f"User ID: {id}"

def log_request(handler):
    def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Received request: {request.path}")
        return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

router.add_route("/user/:id", get_user, methods=["GET"], middlewares=[log_request])
```

### HttpServer

The `HttpServer` class handles the low-level HTTP protocol details.

**Key Features:**

- **Request Handling:** Processes incoming HTTP requests.
- **Response Sending:** Formats and sends HTTP responses.
- **Connection Management:** Manages client connections asynchronously.

**Usage:**

This class is usually managed internally by `AreionServer` and doesn't require direct interaction.

## Default Component Implementation

Areion provides default implementations for several core components that can be used out of the box. These components are designed to work together seamlessly and provide a solid foundation for building web applications. Feel free to use these default components or create your own custom implementations according to the interfaces in `areion/base`.

### Orchestrator

The `Orchestrator` class manages background tasks and scheduling. The startup and shutdown are managed by the `AerionServer`.

**Key Features:**

- **Task Submission:** Allows submitting tasks to be executed asynchronously.
- **Scheduling:** Supports scheduling tasks using cron expressions.
- **Thread Management:** Uses a thread pool for concurrent execution.

**Usage:**

```python
from areion import DefaultOrchestrator

orchestrator = DefaultOrchestrator(max_workers=4)

def background_task():
    print("Running background task")

# Submit a task
orchestrator.submit_task(background_task)

# Schedule a cron task
orchestrator.schedule_cron_task(background_task, {'hour': '*/1'})
```

### Logger

The `Logger` class provides logging capabilities. This logger is passed to multiple other components and also injected into each HttpRequest that is accesible in every route handler.

**Key Features:**

- **Configurable Levels:** Supports standard logging levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.).
- **File and Console Logging:** Can log to both files and the console.
- **Formatter Support:** Customizable log formatting.

**Usage:**

```python
from areion import DefaultLogger, AreionServerBuilder, DefaultRouter

router = DefaultRouter()
logger = DefaultLogger(log_file="server.log", log_level="INFO")

@router.route("/log", methods=["GET"])
def some_handler(request):
    logger.info("Processing request")
    return "Response"

server = AreionServerBuilder().with_router(router).with_logger(logger).build()
```

### Engine

The `Engine` class handles template rendering.

**Key Features:**

**Jinja2 Integration:** Uses Jinja2 for template rendering.
**Template Directory:** Configurable template directory.

**Usage:**

```python
from areion import DefaultEngine

engine = Engine(templates_dir="templates")

# Rendering a template
def home(request):
    context = {"title": "Home"}
    return request.render_template("home.html", context)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Middleware

Middleware functions allow you to process requests and responses globally or for specific routes.

**Creating Middleware:**

```python
def auth_middleware(handler):
    def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
        if not request.get_header("Authorization"):
            return HttpResponse(status_code=401, body="Unauthorized")
        return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

**Applying Middleware:**

**Global Middleware:**

```python
router.add_global_middleware(auth_middleware)
```

**Route-specific Middleware:**

```python
@router.route("/dashboard", middlewares=[auth_middleware])
def dashboard(request):
    return "Welcome to the dashboard"
```

### Grouping Routes

You can group routes under a common path and apply middlewares to the group.

**Usage:**

```python
# Define group-specific middleware
def group_middleware(handler):
    def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
        print("Group middleware executed")
        return handler(request, *args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Create a route group
api_group = router.group("/api", middlewares=[group_middleware])

@api_group.route("/users")
def api_users(request):
    return "API Users"

@api_group.route("/posts")
def api_posts(request):
    return "API Posts"
```

### Template Rendering

Use the Engine component to render templates with dynamic content.

**Usage:**

```python
def profile(request):
    user_data = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
    return request.render_template("profile.html", user_data)
```

### Task Scheduling

Schedule tasks to run at specified intervals using the Orchestrator.

**Usage:**

```python
def cleanup_task():
    print("Performing cleanup")

# Schedule to run every day at midnight
orchestrator.schedule_cron_task(cleanup_task, {'hour': '0', 'minute': '0'})
```

## Exception Handling

Areion provides custom exceptions for common HTTP errors. These exceptions can be raised in route handlers to return the corresponding error response and status code.

- `HttpError`: Base class for HTTP errors.
- `BadRequestError`: Corresponds to 400 Bad Request.
- `UnauthorizedError`: Corresponds to 401 Unauthorized.
- `ForbiddenError`: Corresponds to 403 Forbidden.
- `NotFoundError`: Corresponds to 404 Not Found.
- `MethodNotAllowedError`: Corresponds to 405 Method Not Allowed.
- `InternalServerError`: Corresponds to 500 Internal Server Error.

**Easily create custom exceptions by subclassing the HttpError class.**

**Usage:**

```python
from areion import NotFoundError

def get_item(request, item_id):
    item = database.get(item_id)
    if not item:
        raise NotFoundError("Item not found")
    return item
```

_Exceptions in routes and middleware are handled globally and converted to a proper HTTP response._

## Best Practices

### Responses

We recommend returning a `HttpResponse` object directly from route handlers. This allows for more control over the response status code, headers, and body. Additionally, it is recommended, but not required, to pass an explicit `content_type` during construction for performance reasons.

_Helpful wrappers now exist in the `areion/utils/response_utils.py` to make this easier for common use cases._

_Make sure that objects are JSON serializable before returning them in the response body._

**Example:**

```python
from areion import HttpResponse

@router.route("/user", methods=GET)
def get_user(request):
    user = {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 30
    }
    return HttpResponse(body=user, content_type="application/json")
```

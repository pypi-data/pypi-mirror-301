# RedPepper

RedPepper is a state-based configuration management system written in Python.
It has two basic components: a central manager and one or more agents on controlled servers.
Redpepper is used to distribute configuration to servers and ensure that the servers remain in a consistent state.

RedPepper is primarily targeted for Linux-based systems although it could be partially functional on other OS's as well.

RedPepper is inspired by [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) but aims to be more reliable and easy-to-use.

RedPepper has a REST API for integration with tools or user interfaces.
RedPepper comes with an integrated web UI built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) for managing the system.

> Please note: This project is currently being beta-tested and the bugs are being worked out.
> You can help by testing RedPepper in your own use case and opening issues when you find a flat spot.

## Documentation

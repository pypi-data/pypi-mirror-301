    Use MIMIC (Mutual-Information Maximizing Input Clustering) to find the optimum
    for a given optimization problem.

    MIMIC is a probabilistic optimization algorithm that generates new samples
    based on the mutual information between variables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem: optimization object
        Object containing the optimization problem to be solved.
        Must be a discrete-state problem, such as `DiscreteOpt()` or `TSPOpt()`.

    pop_size: int, default: 200
        Size of the population to be used in the algorithm.
        Must be a positive integer greater than 0.

    keep_pct: float, default: 0.2
        Proportion of samples to keep at each iteration of the algorithm.
        Must be a float between 0 and 1 (exclusive).

    max_attempts: int, default: 10
        Maximum number of attempts to find a better state at each step.
        Must be a positive integer greater than 0.

    noise: float, default: 0.0
        Noise level to be added to the fitness function.
        Must be a float between 0 and 0.1 (inclusive).

    max_iters: int or float, default: np.inf
        Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm.
        Must be a positive integer greater than 0 or `np.inf`.

    curve: bool, default: False
        Whether to keep fitness values for a curve.
        If `False`, then no curve is stored.
        If `True`, then a history of fitness values is provided as a third return value.

    random_state: int, default: None
        Seed for the random number generator.

    state_fitness_callback: callable, default: None
        If specified, this callback function is invoked once per iteration with the following parameters:

        - iteration: int
          The current iteration number (starting from 0). `iteration=0` indicates the initial state before the optimization loop starts.
        - attempt: int
          The current number of consecutive unsuccessful attempts to find a better state.
        - done: bool
          True if the algorithm is about to terminate (max attempts reached, max iterations reached, or `problem.can_stop()` returns True);
          False otherwise.
        - state: np.ndarray
          The current state vector.
        - fitness: float
          The current adjusted fitness value.
        - fitness_evaluations: int
          The cumulative number of fitness evaluations.
        - curve: np.ndarray or None
          The fitness curve up to the current iteration, or `None` if `curve=False`.
        - user_data: dict
          The user data passed in `callback_user_info`.

        The callback should return a boolean: `True` to continue iterating, or `False` to stop.

    callback_user_info: dict, default: None
        Dictionary of user-managed data passed as the `user_data` parameter of the callback function.

    Returns
    -------
    best_state: np.ndarray
        Numpy array containing the state that optimizes the fitness function.

    best_fitness: float
        Value of the fitness function at the best state.

    fitness_curve: np.ndarray
        Numpy array of shape (n_iterations, 2), where each row represents:

        - Column 0: Adjusted fitness at the current iteration.
        - Column 1: Cumulative number of fitness evaluations.

        Only returned if the input argument `curve` is `True`.

    Notes
    -----
    - MIMIC cannot be used for solving continuous-state optimization problems.
    - The `state_fitness_callback` function is also called before the optimization loop starts (iteration 0)
      with the initial state and fitness values.
    - MIMIC generates new samples by building a probabilistic model of the best samples and sampling from this model.

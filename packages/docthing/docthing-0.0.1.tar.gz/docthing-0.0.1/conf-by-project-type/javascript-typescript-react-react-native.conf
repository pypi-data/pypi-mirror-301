# This is a configuration file for docthing.

# Some of the configuration here defined can be overridden by
# command line options.

# This file follows the format of the normal config files with some
# predefiend variables integration and the possibility to use
# configuration values as variables. To keep things simple the
# declared configuration values must appear before their usage in the file.
# Values between curly braces will be replaced with the value of the
# variable; if the variable appears in the same section it is used
# it can be referenced by just ist name (eg. {var}), otherwise it
# must be prefixed with the section name (eg. {section.var}), the
# section being the words between the square brackets.

# Predefined variables:
#   index-file-dir: the directory of the index file


# In the main section goes common configurations
[main]
# index file name (optional; if specified in command line this is ignored)
index_file=docthing.jsonc
# detect languages inside documentation files (markdown is always detected)
meta=plantuml


# This section contains the configuration for the output
[output]
# the directory where the documentation will be created
dir={index-file-dir}/documentation
# the type of documentation to create (the PDF is generated from LaTeX)
type=latex,html,markdown,pdf


[parser]
# the finder will look for these in the files to extract documentation from it
# the regex that will be used will be:
#    /^{begin_ml_comment}\b+{begin_doc}\b+\(.*\)$/ to match the beginning of the documentation
#    /^{end_doc}\b+{end_ml_comment}$/ to match the end of the documentation
# what the parser should look for to find documentation start
begin_doc=BEGIN FILE DOCUMENTATION
# what the parser should look for to find documentation end
end_doc=END FILE DOCUMENTATION
# max documentation level (see documentation for details)
# 0 means no limit
doc_level=1
# extensions to parse (eg. if a directory is passed in the index file
#    these will be used to find file to use to create documentation)
extensions=js,jsx,ts,tsx
# ignore files with these extensions
iexts=test.{extensions}

# normally only multine comments are allowed
allow_sl_comments=false
# controls how many lines are peeked before giving up finding documentation for the file
# 0 means check all lines (not recommended)

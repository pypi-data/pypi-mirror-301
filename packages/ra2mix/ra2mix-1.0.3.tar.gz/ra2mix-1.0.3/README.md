A python library for working with Red Alert 2 / Yuri's Revenge *.mix files

Mix files are archive files used to store most game files from the games
**Command And Conquer Red Alert 2** and its expansion pack **Yuri's Revenge**.

This library allows you to interact with the mix files much like you'd interact with
zip files using a program like 7-zip -- except programmatically, of course ðŸ˜Ž.  You can
create mix files by archiving a list of several files, or read existing mix files
and do something with the archived files contained within it.

## Installation
```bash
pip install ra2mix
```

## Usage
Import the package

```python
import ra2mix
```

### Reading a `*.mix` file

- **Read**:

    The `ra2mix.read` function can take a `*.mix` filepath and return a
    `dict[str, bytes]` object. The keys are filenames and the values are file data as
    bytes.

    ```python
    import ra2mix
    mix_filepath = "path/to/mixfile.mix"

    filemap = ra2mix.read(mix_filepath)
    print(f"filenames: {list(filemap.keys())}")

    for filename, file_data in filemap.items():
        # do something with the file data
    ```

- **Extract**:

    The `ra2mix.extract` function takes a `*.mix` filepath and an extraction folder
    path.  The files contained in the mix file will be written to the folder.

    ```python
    import ra2mix
    mix_filepath = "path/to/mixfile.mix"
    extract_folder = "extract/to/folder"

    ra2mix.extract(mix_filepath, extract_folder)
    ```

### Creating a `*.mix` file

The `ra2mix.write` function supports three methods for specifying files to include in a
new `*.mix` file:
- `filemap`: A `dict[str, bytes]` object consisting of filenames and file data
- `folder_path`: A path to a folder; all files in the folder are added to the mix
- `filepaths`: A `list[str]` containing exact filepaths to include in the mix

```python
import ra2mix
mix_filepath = "path/to/mixfile.mix"

target_folder = "read/from/folder"

mix_data = ra2mix.write(mix_filepath, folder_path=target_folder)

# Optionally do something with mix_data if you want; file is already written to
# `mix_filepath`
```

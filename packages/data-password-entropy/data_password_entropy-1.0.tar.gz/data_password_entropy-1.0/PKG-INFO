## Synopsis
```bash
pip install data-password-entropy
```

```python-repl
>>> from data_password_entropy import password_entropy
>>> password_entropy('password')
35
>>> password_entropy('Vgk4@HDk6X7gEp7')
85
```


## Overview
The `data-password-entropy` package provides a function to calculate the entropy of a password, measuring its strength against brute-force attacks. Unlike traditional rule-based methods that enforce specific criteria—such as minimum length or mandatory punctuation—which can either reject strong, unconventional passwords or accept weak ones like `P@ssw0rd`, entropy-based evaluation offers a more accurate assessment. By assigning a numerical value to a password's complexity and unpredictability, this empirical algorithm ensures that a password achieving an entropy score of 80 bits is considered sufficiently secure for most applications.

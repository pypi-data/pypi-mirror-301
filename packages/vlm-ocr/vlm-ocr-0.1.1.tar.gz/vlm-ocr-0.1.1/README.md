The purpose of this is to create a multitude of implementations to parse PDFs into text.
Specifically, these implementations will be using VLMs (hence the name VLM-OCR).

Usage:
1. pip install requirements.txt (venv or conda env recommended)
2. create a .env file with the key for your chosen API
3. pick the function corresponding to the LLM provider you're using

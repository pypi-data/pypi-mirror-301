# MineMind

Low-level API for creating minecraft bots.


## Supported Versions

- 1.20.3

## Installation

```bash
pip install minemind
```

## Example

Say hello world to the server.

````python
import asyncio
from minemind.protocols.v765.bot import Bot


async def main():
    async with Bot(username='Steve', host='localhost', port=25565) as bot:
        await bot.chat_message('Hello, world!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
````

React to different events.

````python
import asyncio
from minemind.dispatcher import EventDispatcher
from minemind.protocols.v765.bot import Bot
from minemind.protocols.v765.inbound.play import CollectResponse


@EventDispatcher.subscribe(CollectResponse)
async def pickup_item(data: CollectResponse):
    print(f'Bot picked up {data.pickup_item_count} items')


async def main():
    await Bot().run_forever()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
````

Get server information.

````python
import asyncio

from minemind.client import Client
from minemind.protocols.v765.server import Server


async def main():
    async with Client(host='localhost', port=25565) as client:
        server = Server(client)
        print(await server.get_info())


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
````

## Documentation
TBD

### Testing
To test your bot, you can start simple local server using docker (it's using itzg/minecraft-server image):
```bash
docker-compose up
````

### Debugging
Library provides three levels of debugging:
- [DEBUG=3] DEBUG_GAME_EVENTS: Print game events, like player movement, chat messages, damage received, etc.
- [DEBUG=2] DEBUG_PROTOCOL: Print all protocol messages, like handshaking, received events, map loading, etc. + DEBUG_GAME_EVENTS
- [DEBUG=1] DEBUG_TRACE: Lower socket level debugging, like connection status, sent and received packets, etc. + DEBUG_PROTOCOL

You can set the debug level by setting the environment variable `DEBUG` to one of the values above, e.g. to set debug level to `DEBUG_PROTOCOL`:
```bash
DEBUG=2 python my_script.py
```

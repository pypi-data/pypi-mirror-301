Skeleton Map Creation and Manipulation.

Definitions
-----------
A map is a Numpy ndarray representing one or several object over a background. It exists in several variants:
- Boolean  map: ndarray of type bool            where the object(s) are labeled True and the background is False.
- Binary   map: ndarray of type int8  or uint8  where the object(s) are labeled 1 and the background is 0.
- Labeled  map: ndarray of type int64 or uint64 where the objects   are labeled from 1 with successive integers,
and the background is 0.
- Topology map: ndarray of type int8  or uint8  where each object site (pixel, voxel...) has a value between 0 and
3^D - 1, where D is the number of dimensions of the array, and the background is 3^D. The values correspond to the
number of neighboring sites belonging to the object with the weakest connectivity (8 in 2-D, 26 in 3-D...).

These variants are abbreviated omp, ymp, lmp, and tmp, respectively, to be used as a variable name postfix, e.g.,
edge_ymp.

For maps that can be of signed or unsigned types, the signed version is usually preferred to make them subtractable.

A skeleton map, normally abbreviated as skl_map, is a 2- or 3-dimensional boolean or binary map in which no site (pixel
or voxel) with value True, respectively 1, can be set to False, respectively 0, without breaking the skeleton
connectivity (in the weakest sense) or shortening a branch.

Simple example usage:
>>> # --- Object
>>> import skimage.data as data
>>> import skimage.util as util
>>> object_map = util.invert(data.horse())
>>> # --- SKL Map
>>> from skl_graph.type.skl_map import SKLMapFromObjectMap, PruneSKLMapBasedOnWidth
>>> skl_map, width_map = SKLMapFromObjectMap(object_map, with_width=True)
>>> pruned_map = skl_map.copy()
>>> PruneSKLMapBasedOnWidth(pruned_map, width_map, 20)
>>> # --- Plotting
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
>>> _, all_axes = pyplot.subplots(ncols=4)
>>> all_axes[0].matshow(object_map, cmap="gray")
>>> all_axes[1].matshow(skl_map, cmap="gray")
>>> all_axes[2].matshow(width_map, cmap="hot")
>>> all_axes[3].matshow(pruned_map, cmap="gray")
>>> for axes, title in zip(all_axes, ("Object", "Skeleton", "Width", "Pruned Skeleton")):
>>>     axes.set_title(title)
>>>     axes.set_axis_off()
>>> pyplot.tight_layout()
>>> pyplot.show()

# Choosing a build backend:

[build-system]
# A list of packages that are needed to build your package:
requires = ["setuptools"]  # REQUIRED if [build-system] table is used
# The name of the Python object that frontends will use to perform the build:
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"  # If not defined, then legacy behavior can happen.


[project]
# This is the name of your project. The first time you publish this
# package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
# users can install this project, e.g.:
#
# $ pip install sampleproject
#
# And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/
#
# There are some restrictions on what makes a valid project name
# specification here:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#name
name = "oqd-cloud-server"  # REQUIRED, is the only field that cannot be marked as dynamic.

# Versions should comply with PEP 440:
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
#
# For a discussion on single-sourcing the version, see
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/
version = "0.0.0"  # REQUIRED, although can be dynamic

# This is a one-line description or tagline of what your project does. This
# corresponds to the "Summary" metadata field:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#summary
description = "A sample Python project"

# This is an optional longer description of your project that represents
# the body of text which users will see when they visit PyPI.
#
# Often, this is the same as your README, so you can just read it in from
# that file directly.
#
# This field corresponds to the "Description" metadata field:
# https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/#description-optional

# Specify which Python versions you support. In contrast to the
# 'Programming Language' classifiers in this file, 'pip install' will check this
# and refuse to install the project if the version does not match. See
# https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#python-requires
requires-python = ">=3.8"

# This is either text indicating the license for the distribution, or a file
# that contains the license.

  #   4 - Beta

  # Pick your license as you wish
  "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",

  # Specify the Python versions you support here. In particular, ensure
  # that you indicate you support Python 3. These classifiers are *not*
  # checked by "pip install". See instead "requires-python" key in this file.

summary: Python interface to libapt-pkg
maintainer: tester <test@testhost>
description: |
  The apt_pkg Python interface will provide full access to the internal
  libapt-pkg structures allowing Python programs to easily perform a
  variety of functions, such as:  - Access to the APT configuration
  system - Access to the APT package information database - Parsing of
  Debian package control files, and other files with a   similar
  structure The included 'aptsources' Python interface provides an
  abstraction of the sources.list configuration on the repository and
  the distro level.

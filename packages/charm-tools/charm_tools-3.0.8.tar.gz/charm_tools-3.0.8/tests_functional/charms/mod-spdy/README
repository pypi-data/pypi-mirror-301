Configuration
-------------

This will open port 443 on any machine with apache and enable mod_spdy.

juju deploy wrdpress
juju deploy mysql
juju add-relation mysql wordpress
juju expose wordpress
juju deploy mod-spdy
juju add-relation mod-spdy wordpress

Now, juju does not allow subordinates to open ports for their primaries,
so you have to use the 'open-port' script in juju-jitsu.

To do that, after you've done the steps above:

bzr branch lp:juju-jitsu
juju-jitsu/sub-commands/open-port your-primary-service 443

https://your-public-ip/ should be SSL, and should be using SPDY if you
try it in Chrome/Chromium.

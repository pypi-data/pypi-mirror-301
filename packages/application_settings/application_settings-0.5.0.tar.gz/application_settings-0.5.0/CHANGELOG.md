## [0.3.0] - 2023-06-21

### Added - 0.3.0

- Multiple versions of documentation served on Github Pages.
- You can now request a (re-) load when setting the filepath or via a method `load`.
- You can choose whether or not to throw a `FileNotFoundError` during `load`
  when the parameter file is not found in the expected location
  (Issue [#51](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/51))
- Support for parameters in the main container (Issue
  [#20](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/20)).
- Support for subsections (arbitrary depth) (Issue
  [#5](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/5)).
- Sections also stored as a singleton, so that libs can define and access parameters
  via their own Section (Issue 
  [#46](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/46)).
- Literal SectionTypeStr exported.
- Convenience functions to specify filepath for config and settings via command-line
  [[#53](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/53)]

### Changed - 0.3.0

- The method `update` now is a class method (breaking).
- You cannot request a reload via method `get` anymore, use separate method `load`
  (breaking).

### Fixed - 0.3.0

- Default folder name no longer just a dot if container class is called Config or
  Settings.

### Added - 0.2.0

- Files can be formatted as `toml` or `json`.

- Now also useable with python 3.9.
- Documentation extended and served on Github Pages.

### Changed - 0.2.0

  `get()`.

## [0.1.0] - 2023-02-13

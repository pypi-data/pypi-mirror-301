## Usage

Install the library:
```
pip install bettercorrectfast
```

Create and save an issue locally:
```
import bettercorrectfast as bcf

issue = bcf.create("Title", "Description", "Screenshot.jpg")
bcf.save(issue, "issue.bcf")
```

It is also possible to add a title, description and/or snapshot to the issue:

```
issue_from_text = bcf.create("Title", "Description")

issue_from_title = bcf.create(title="Title)
issue_from_description = bcf.create(description="Description")
issue_from_image = bcf.create(image_filepath="Screenshot.jpg")
```

## Technical Notes

The issue schema conforms to the BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) version 2.0 standard as defined by buildingSMART International.

**Note:** This library currently supports image snapshots exclusively in .png format. Support for .jpg format is under development.

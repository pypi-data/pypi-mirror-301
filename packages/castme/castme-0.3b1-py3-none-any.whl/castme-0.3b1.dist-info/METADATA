# CastMe

CastMe is a simple Python REPL that allows you to cast music from a Subsonic server to a Chromecast device.

**NOTE: The subsonic server must expose a URL over HTTPS. And since the chromecast will be the one connecting to the server, the certificate need to be trusted. This project is tested against [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) only.**

It's pretty bare-bone for now, but as I am using it more and more I will add the features that I need.

### Installation (pip / pipx / ...)

`castme` is available directly in pypi:
```
pip install castme
```

Just create the configuration file using `--init` and edit the content:

```
> castme --init
Configuration initialized in /home/blizarre/.config/castme.toml, please edit it before starting castme again
```

Castme will look for the `castme.toml` file in `/etc` or in the current directory as well. use `--config` in conjunction with `--init` to set the location of the configuration file.

### Usage
- Run the script, a REPL will appear:

```bash
> poetry run castme
Loading config from /home/blizarre/.config/castme.toml
looking for chromecast Living Room TV
Chromecast ready
>> play Harold enItal
Playing song Harold in the mountains (Adagio - Allegro) / Harold en Italie by Hector Berlioz
>> queue
 0 The Pilgrim's Procession (Allegretto) / Harold en Italie by Hector Berlioz
 1 Serenade of an Abruzzian highlander (Allegro assai) / Harold en Italie by Hector Berlioz
 2 The Robbers' orgies (Allegro frenetico) / Harold en Italie by Hector Berlioz
>> playpause
>> playpause
>> quit
```

commands: `help  list (l),  next (n),  play (p),  playpause (pp),  queue (q),  quit (x),  volume (v)`.
Aliases are defined for the most common commands (in parenthesis).


### Installation (dev)
- Clone the repository
- Install the required dependencies using Poetry or the `install` makefile target:

```bash
make install
```
- Copy the config file template "castme/assets/castme.toml.template" to one of the supported directory and update the values inside
  - "castme.toml"
  - "~/.config/castme.toml"
  - "/etc/castme.toml"

During development, `make dev` will run the formatters and linters for the project.

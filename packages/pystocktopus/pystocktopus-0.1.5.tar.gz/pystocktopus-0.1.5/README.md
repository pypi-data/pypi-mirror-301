to streamline your stock-related tasks.

## Key Features

- CSV Data Maintenance:

pystocktopus provides a seamless solution for maintaining your stock data in CSV
format. Whether you need to update existing data or extract new data from a CSV
file, this package streamlines the process, ensuring that your stock data is
always up-to-date and readily accessible.

- Current Closing Price Extraction:

pystocktopus simplifies the process of extracting the current closing price for
a specific stock. With just a few lines of code, you can access up-to-the-minute
price information, enabling you to monitor your investments with precision.

## Here are some examples of how the package can be used:

## Upgrade your CSV dashboard with new data:

```.py
from pystocktopus.stock_csv import CSVDataHandler

# Define the path to the user's CSV file and the column names for tickers and amounts
user_csv_file = 'TestCSV.csv'
column_ticker_name = "Tickers"
column_amount_name = "Amount"

# Print the user's CSV file path
print(user_csv_file)

# Read ticker values from the CSV file using the specified column name
ticker_values = CSVDataHandler.csv_data_reader(user_csv_file, column_ticker_name)

# Read amount values from the CSV file using the specified column name
amount_values = CSVDataHandler.csv_data_reader(user_csv_file, column_amount_name)

# Print the extracted ticker and amount values
print(ticker_values)
print(amount_values)

# Sample closing data for SONY and AMZN stocks
closing_data = {'SONY': [93.6, 93.49, 91.07, 90.03, 90.19, 90.44, 89.82, 83.85],
                'AMZN': [133.68, 131.69, 128.21, 128.91, 139.57, 142.22, 139.94, 137.85]}

# Combine the amount values with the closing data
result = CSVDataHandler.combine_data_csv(amount_values, closing_data)

# Update the user's CSV file with the combined data
CSVDataHandler.update_csv(user_csv_file, result)

# Close and clean up resources for the closing data
CSVDataHandler.close_list_csv(closing_data)

```

# Do something with the extracted data

# For example, plot the closing prices over time:

```.py
# Load the CSV dashboard
dashboard = pystocktopus.load_dashboard("my_dashboard.csv")

# Calculate a technical indicator, such as the moving average
moving_average = dashboard.calculate_moving_average(period=20)

# Perform statistical analysis on the data, such as calculating the correlation between two stocks
correlation = dashboard.calculate_correlation("AAPL", "GOOG")

# Generate a chart of the data, such as a candlestick chart
candlestick_chart = dashboard.plot_candlestick_chart()
```

# Do something with the analysis results

# For example, want to predict some data using past Closing price

```.py
# Import the necessary modules
from __future__ import annotations

from pystocktopus.stock_forecasting import ModelStockData

# Specify the path to the CSV file containing the stock data
csv_file = "stock_data-2.csv"

# Create and fit an LSTM model to the stock data
ModelStockData.create_and_fit_lstm_model(
    csv_file, sequence_length=10, epochs=50, stacked=False
)
print(ModelStockData)
```

# For example, display the candlestick chart:

```.py
from pystocktopus.stock_forecasting import DataAnalysis

# Create an interactive bar chart of the stock price data with volume and 20-day moving average
DataAnalysis.interactive_bar(csv_file)

# Create an interactive candlestick chart of the stock price data
DataAnalysis.interactive_sticks(csv_file)

# Perform a basic analysis of the stock price data
DataAnalysis.stock_analysis(csv_file)
```

# Do something with the sentiment predictions

# For example, identify the most positive and negative news articles:

```.py
from pystocktopus.news_analysis import News

# Create a list of tickers to extract news articles for
ticker_values = ["GOOGL"]

# Specify the date range to extract news articles for
predict_date = "2023-08-05"

# Call the new_data_extract() method to extract news articles for the given tickers and date range
news_articles = News.new_data_extract(ticker_values, predict_date)

# Call the news_predict_analysis() method to predict the sentiment of the news articles for each ticker
analysis_results = News.news_predict_analysis(news_articles)

# Call the create_csv_with_predictions() method to create a CSV file with the predicted sentiment for each ticker
csv_filename = "news_predictions.csv"
News.create_csv_with_predictions(csv_filename, analysis_results)

```

# Display the most positive and negative news articles:

```.py
import pystocktopus.news_analysis as news

result_strings = {
    "Ticker1": "Day1: i am excellent\nDay2: i am good\n",
    "Ticker2": "Day1: Title3\nDay2: Title4\n",
}
news_data = news.News.news_predict_analysis(result_strings)
print(news_data)
csv_filename = 'Test_result'
news.News.create_csv_with_predictions(csv_filename,news_data)
```

# Get the current closing price for Amazon

```.py
# Import the StockExtractor class from the pystocktopus.core library.
from pystocktopus.core import StockExtractor

# Set the ticker values, timespan, multiplier, and user date.
ticker_values = ["AMZN", "SONY"]
timespan = "day"
multiplier = 1
user_date = "2023-09-20"

# Extract the closing prices for the specified tickers, timespan, multiplier, and user date.
Closing_price = StockExtractor.ticker_data_collection(ticker_values, timespan, multiplier, user_date)

# Print the closing prices to the console.
print(Closing_price)
```

# Do something with the current closing price

# For example, print it to the console:

```.py
print("Current closing price for Amazon:", Closing_price)
```

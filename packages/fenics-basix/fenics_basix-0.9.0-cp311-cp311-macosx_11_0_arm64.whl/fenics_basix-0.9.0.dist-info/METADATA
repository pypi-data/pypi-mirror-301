# Basix

[![Basix CI](https://github.com/FEniCS/basix/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FEniCS/basix/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml)
[![Spack install](https://github.com/FEniCS/basix/actions/workflows/spack.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FEniCS/basix/actions/workflows/spack.yml)

Basix is a finite element definition and tabulation runtime library.
Basix allows users to:

- evaluate finite element basis functions and their derivatives at a set
  of points;
- access geometric and topological information about reference cells;
- apply push forward and pull back operations to map data between a
  reference cell and a physical cell;
- permute and transform DOFs to allow higher-order elements to be use on
  arbitrary meshes; and
- interpolate into and between finite element spaces.

Basix includes a range of built-in elements, and also allows the user to
define their own custom elements.

Basix is one of the components of FEniCSx, alongside
[UFL](https://github.com/fenics/ufl),
[FFCx](https://github.com/fenics/ffcx), and
[DOLFINx](https://github.com/fenics/dolfinx).


## Installation

To install Basix:
```console
pip install fenics-basix
```
We currently build binary wheels for Linux and macOS x86-64 architectures.

For advanced and developer installation instructions see the more
detailed [install instructions](INSTALL.md)

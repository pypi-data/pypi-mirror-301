**AndroidViewClient/culebra** was initially conceived as an extension to [monkeyrunner](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkeyrunner_concepts.html)  but has since evolved
into a versatile pure Python tool.
It streamlines test script creation for Android applications by automating tasks and simplifying interactions. This test framework:
<ul><ul>
  <li>Automates the navigation of Android applications.</li>
  <li>Generates reusable scripts for efficient testing.</li>
  <li>Offers device-independent UI interaction based on views.</li>
  <li>Utilizes 'logical' screen comparison (UI Automator Hierarchy based) instead of image comparison, avoiding extraneous detail issues like time or data changes.</li>
  <li>Supports concurrent operation on multiple devices.</li>
  <li>Provides straightforward control for high-level operations such as language change and activity start.</li>
  <li>Fully supports all Android APIs.</li>
  <li>Written in Python with support for Python 3.6 and above in versions 20.x.y and beyond.</li>
</ul></ul>

**ðŸ›Ž** |A new Kotlin backend is under development to provide more functionality and improve performance.<br>Take a look at [CulebraTester2](https://github.com/dtmilano/CulebraTester2-public) and 20.x.y-series prerelease. |

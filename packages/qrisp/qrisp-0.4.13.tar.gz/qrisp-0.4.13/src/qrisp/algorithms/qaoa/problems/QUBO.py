    """
    Solves a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). 
    The function imports the default backend from the 'qrisp.default_backend' module. 
    It defines a quantum argument as a QuantumArray of len(Q) QuantumVariables with size 1. 
    It then runs the QAOA with the given quantum arguments, ``depth``, measurement keyword arguments, and a maximum of 50 iterations for optimization. 
    The functions then considers the first ``n_solutions`` solutions of the QAOA optimization, and as a classical post processing, 
    calculates the cost for each such solution, sorts the solutions by their cost in ascending order, and prints the solutions with their corresponding costs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Q : np.array
        QUBO matrix to solve.
    depth : int
        The depth (amount of layers) of the QAOA circuit.
    max_iter : int
        The maximal amount of iterations of the COBYLA optimizer in the QAOA algorithm.
    backend : str
        The backend to be used for the quantum/annealing simulation.
    n_solutions : int
        The number of solutions to consider for classical post processing. The defalut is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    optimal_solution: tuple
        The function returns the optimal solution as a tuple where the first element is the cost and the second element is the optimal bitstring. If print_res is set to True, the function prints the runtime of the QAOA algorithm and the ``n_solutions`` best solutions with their respective costs.

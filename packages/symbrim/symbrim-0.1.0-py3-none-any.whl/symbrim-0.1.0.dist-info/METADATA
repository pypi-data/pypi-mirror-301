This package is still under development, therefore there is no guarantee on backward
compatibility.

## Installation
`SymBRiM` is currently not available on `PyPI`. Therefore, you'll need to install the
development version from GitHub using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mechmotum/symbrim.git
```
The optional dependencies can be installed with:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleParameters.git
pip install symmeplot
```

    title = {BRiM: A Modular Bicycle-Rider Modeling Framework},
    abstract = {The development of computationally efficient and validated single-track vehicle-rider models has traditionally required handcrafted one-off models. Here we introduce BRiM, a software package that facilitates building these models in a modular fashion while retaining access to the mathematical elements for handcrafted modeling when desired. We demonstrate the flexibility of the software by constructing the Carvallo-Whipple bicycle model with different numerical parameters representing different bicycles, modifying it with a front fork suspension travel model, and extending it with moving rider arms driven by joint torques at the elbows. Using these models we solve a lane-change optimal control problem for six different model variations which solve in mere seconds on a modern personal computer. Our tool enables flexible and rapid modeling of single-track vehicle-rider models that give precise results at high computational efficiency.},

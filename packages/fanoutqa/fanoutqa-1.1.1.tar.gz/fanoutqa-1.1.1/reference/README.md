# Reference Implementations

This directory contains reference implementations of experiments run in the FanOutQA paper. These implementations are
provided "as-is", with no guarantees on usability or support provided. Note the code quality of these implementations
may be lower than the library code, as these are earlier explorations run a) on a deadline and b) to develop the 
interfaces that were eventually exposed in this library.

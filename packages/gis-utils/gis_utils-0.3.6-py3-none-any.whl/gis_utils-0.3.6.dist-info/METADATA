gis-utils
-----------------------------------------------
Convenience functions for working with geospatial data in python. The python geospatial stack (`fiona`, `shapely`, `rasterio`, `pyproj`, `rtree`, and others) combined with `numpy` and `pandas` provides enormous power and flexibility for geospatial analysis. However, common geoprocessing tasks often require several lines of boiler-plate code that can be tedious, repetitive and difficult to remember. `gis-utils` aims to distill these operations into simple, robust functions that can be imported into any workflow, to reduce cognitive load and allow effort to be focused on the more important parts of the analysis.

### Install python and dependency packages
Download and install the [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
Open an Anaconda Command Prompt on Windows or a terminal window on OSX.
From the root folder for the package (that contains `requirements.yml`), install the above packages from `requirements.yml`.

```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```
activate the environment:

```
conda activate gisutils
```

### Install to site_packages folder
```
python setup.py install
```
### Install the source code in-place
(for development or git users that want to easily *pull* the most recent code)  
* don't forget the `'.'`!

```  
pip install -e .
```

### Bugs

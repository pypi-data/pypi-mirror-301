## About

GraphXplore is a tool for visually exploring, cleaning and transforming your data, as well as defining and sharing 
metadata and mappings with others. You can access GraphXplore as a Python package, or use its graphical user interface 
application. The app can either be run as a local webserver or a standalone desktop app.
GraphXplore does not require advanced knowledge about statistics or data science and the app can be used without prior 
coding/scripting skills. The tool was designed with the application to the medical research domain in mind, but can be 
generally used with any data source.

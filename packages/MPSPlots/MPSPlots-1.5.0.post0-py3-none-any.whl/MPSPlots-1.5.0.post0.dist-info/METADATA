The library
***********

My personal Matplotlib[2D]/PyVista[3D] wrapper. Its aim is to offer a good compromise between ease-of-use and flexibility. I have started this library in order to uniformise my plots for scientific journal and as of today I continue to update and distribute the code.

----

Testing
*******

To test localy (with cloning the GitHub repository) you'll need to install the dependencies and run the coverage command as

.. code:: console

   >>> git clone https://github.com/MartinPdeS/MPSPlots.git
   >>> cd MPSPlots
   >>> pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
   >>> coverage run --source=MPSPlots --module pytest --verbose tests
   >>> coverage report --show-missing

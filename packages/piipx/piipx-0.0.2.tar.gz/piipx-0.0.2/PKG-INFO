# piipx

This package name is reserved to publish a variant of pipx that helps to prevent installing unintended packages, similar to how [piiip](https://pypi.org/project/piiip/) works. If you would like to see piipx released, please open or comment in an issue at the [piiip repository](https://github.com/TNO-S3/piiip/issues) so we can prioritize its development.

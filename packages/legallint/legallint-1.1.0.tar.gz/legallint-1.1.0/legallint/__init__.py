__description__ = """
LegalLint is a cross-platform tool designed to ensure license compliance across 
multiple programming languages by analyzing dependencies and enforcing predefined 
license policies. 

LegalLint helps maintain legal standards by scanning the projectâ€™s dependencies and 
ensuring that only approved licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) are used.
"""

__features__ = """
Cross-Language License Checking: 
    LegalLint is designed to support multiple languages, providing static license checking for Python, 
    with plans to support other languages like JavaScript, Java, Ruby, and more in the future.

Flexible Integration: 
    Integrates smoothly into various build systems and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that license compliance 
    is enforced across all stages of development.

Support and Beyond: 
    With initial support for Python projects (using Poetry or pip), LegalLint will extend to other package managers 
    like npm (package.json), Maven (pom.xml), and others.

Customizable License Policies: 
    Users can configure the tool to accept or reject specific licenses, making it adaptable to different 
    legal requirements or organizational policies.

Comprehensive License Auditing: 
    LegalLint generates detailed reports on non-compliant dependencies, offering insights into 
    potential legal risks.

Extensibility: 
    Built to be extensible so developers can add new language support or custom rules for specific license scenarios.

**Description:**

I've just completed an exciting ETL journey, leveraging the power of Medallion architecture! 🚀 This Python notebook seamlessly extracts, transforms, and loads data from my Upstox trading account into a multi-tiered storage system: BRONZE, SILVER, and GOLD layers. It's a powerful way to enhance data management, analytics, and decision-making in my trading activities.

**Key Highlights:**

📊 **Medallion Architecture**: Designed to efficiently handle data at scale, ensuring robust ETL processes that can grow with my trading data needs.

🔗 **Upstox Integration**: Seamlessly connect with my Upstox trading account to retrieve real-time and historical data.

🛠️ **ETL Workflow**: Perform data extraction, apply transformations, and load the processed data into multiple layers to facilitate various analytics and reporting needs.

📈 **BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD Layers**: Structured storage tiers for raw data (BRONZE), cleaned and transformed data (SILVER), and curated data ready for analysis (GOLD).

📊 **Presentation Layer**: Another companion notebook creates interactive visualizations and insights from the GOLD layer data, making it easier to understand my trading performance and make informed decisions.

📓 **Educational Tool**: A valuable resource for traders looking to optimize their data analysis workflow.

👩‍💼 **Financial Decision Support**: Empowering traders with data-driven insights to improve decision-making and optimize their trading strategies.

**Stay tuned for the upcoming presentation layer notebook! 📊💡**

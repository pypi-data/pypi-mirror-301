Or, with Docker:

docker run --rm -it \
  -v /path/to/config:/root/.config/sachi \
  -v /path/to/media:/media \

```

## Features

Development is still in early stages, here's what's implemented so far:

- File selection
- TVDB series search (requires an API key)
- Movies custom renaming
- Filename jinja2 templating

In progress:

- FileBot context (https://www.filebot.net/naming.html)

The global configuration can be edited with `sachi config`.

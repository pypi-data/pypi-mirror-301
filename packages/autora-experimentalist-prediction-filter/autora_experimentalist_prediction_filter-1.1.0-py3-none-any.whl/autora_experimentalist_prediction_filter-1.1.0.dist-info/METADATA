# AutoRA Prediction Filter Experimentalist

Filter conditions based on the model's prediction.

## Example

For instance, we can filter conditions where the predictions are None values:
If the function is $f(x)=\sqrt((x**2 - 4))$, then the filter can filter out
conditions in the interval $(-2, 2)$.

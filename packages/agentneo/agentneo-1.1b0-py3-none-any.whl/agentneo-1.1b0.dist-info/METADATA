## 🛠 Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **npm**: Version 6 or higher (or **yarn** 1.22+ as an alternative)

## 📦 Installation

Install AgentNeo effortlessly using pip:

```bash
pip install agentneo
```

### Install Node.js and npm (or yarn)

The dashboard component requires Node.js and npm/yarn. Follow these steps to install them:

- **Node.js and npm**: Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.
- **yarn (optional)**: If you prefer yarn over npm, install it globally after Node.js:

  ```bash
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

### Verify the Installations

Ensure that Node.js and npm/yarn are correctly installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version  # or yarn --version
```

**Note**: AgentNeo will attempt to install the necessary React dependencies automatically when you launch the dashboard for the first time.

## 🌟 Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AgentNeo in just a few steps!

### 1. Import the Necessary Components

```python
from agentneo import AgentNeo, Tracer, Evaluation, launch_dashboard
```

### 2. Create a Session and Project

```python
neo_session = AgentNeo(session_name="my_session")
neo_session.create_project(project_name="my_project")
```

### 3. Initialize the Tracer

```python
tracer = Tracer(session=neo_session, log_file_path="trace.json")
tracer.start()
```

### 4. Instrument Your Code

Wrap your functions with AgentNeo's decorators to start tracing:

```python
@tracer.trace_llm("my_llm_call")
async def my_llm_function():
    # Your LLM call here
    pass

@tracer.trace_tool("my_tool")
def my_tool_function():
    # Your tool logic here
    pass

@tracer.trace_agent("my_agent")
def my_agent_function():
    # Your agent logic here
    pass
```

### 5. Stop Tracing and Launch the Dashboard

```python
tracer.stop()

launch_dashboard(port=3000)
```

Access the interactive dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Project Management

Manage multiple projects with ease.

- **List All Projects**

  ```python
  projects = neo_session.list_projects()
  ```

- **Connect to an Existing Project**

  ```python
  neo_session.connect_project(project_name="existing_project")
  ```

### Execution Graph Visualization

AgentNeo generates an execution graph that visualizes the flow of your AI application, including LLM calls, tool usage, and agent interactions. Explore this graph in the interactive dashboard to gain deeper insights.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The AgentNeo dashboard offers a comprehensive view of your AI application's performance:

- **Project Overview**
- **System Information**
- **LLM Call Statistics**
- **Tool and Agent Interaction Metrics**
- **Execution Graph Visualization**
- **Timeline of Events**

### Launching the Dashboard

```python
from agentneo import launch_dashboard
launch_dashboard(port=3000)
```

**Note**: The first time you launch the dashboard, AgentNeo will install necessary React dependencies. This may take a few moments.

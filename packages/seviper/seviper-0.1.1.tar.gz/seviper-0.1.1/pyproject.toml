    # We have to distinguish between those optional dependencies which are intended for the users of seviper (like `seviper[aiostream]` which we mention in our README).
    # Those are NOT pinned because seviper works with any recent version of aiostream and we don't want to restrict the users of the library.
    # But those optional dependencies which we only use for our (internal) CI/CD pipeline (like coverage, formatting etc.) are pinned,
    # because they are not inteded for external use but give us a stable and reproducable CI and dev experience.

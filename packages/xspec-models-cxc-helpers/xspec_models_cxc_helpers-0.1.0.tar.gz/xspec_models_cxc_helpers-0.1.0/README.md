# Helper routines for xspec-models-cxc

It looks like it might be helpful to separate out the build
section - that is, the code needed to generate the code needed
to build an interface to XSPEC or XSPEC user models - from the
module that actually builds the interface
([xspec-models-cxc](https://github.com/cxcsds/xspec-models-cxc)).

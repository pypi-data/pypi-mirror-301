# Only valid for this module, loads template variables from environment
#
# In the example below we are setting up a project based on the Open Industry Data (OID), 
# that originates from the Valhall oil rig. Note that the location/site is NOT used
# to structure the data when on-boarding. The expectation is that a single source system
# and it's data pipeline may supply data for multiple locations/sites.
# The structuring of the data based on site/location should happen as part of processing
# the data in CDF, i.e. contextualisation.
#
# Each of data resource types have assigned the source system where the data originates from.
# This information will be used to construct RAW database names, and to create data sets in CDF,
# and can be used to control access.

    MetaCopier API

    Explore the power of the MetaCopier API! Our RESTful API offers scalable and secure access to accounts, projects, and more. Get started quickly with authentication, explore endpoints, and access code samples in various languages.<br/><br/>All dates are in ISO 8601<br/><br/>This API is not designed for real-time communication purposes. For instance, continuously polling account information such as open positions every second is not recommended.<br/><br/>Our frontend uses this API, so you can look at the requests on our frontend for examples.

Module for the Server.

The server listens for incoming connections from playback clients and web
clients via the socket.io protocol.

It manages multiple independent rooms, each with its own queue and configuration.
If configured, the server can be in private mode, where only playback clients with
a valid registration key can connect. It can also be in restricted mode, where only
search is forwarded to the playback client, unless the client has a valid registration
key.

IGB Python Utilities
====================

This is a collection of various Python tools, libraries, and utilities
developed at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries
(IGB) in the Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V. (https://www.igb-berlin.de/en).

This is a companion library to the ``igbdatatools`` library
(https://github.com/haukex/igbdatatools) which normally targets the latest
Python version.
This library is intended to contain more general-purpose tools and
cover a slightly broader range of Python versions, currently Python 3.9 to 3.12.

The documentation is available at https://igbpyutils.readthedocs.io/

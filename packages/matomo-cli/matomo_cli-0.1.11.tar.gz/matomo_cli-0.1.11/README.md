# Readme

This is a simple CLI tool for Matomo API requests and a [Prometheus exporter](https://prometheus.io/) for Matomo.

This was created as a need for a Prometheus exporter for Matomo, and we, [Digitalist Open Cloud](https://digitalist.cloud/), needed a base to test calls to Matomo. Hopefully it could be used and developed together with the community.

## Environment variables

Many options could be replaced with environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Description             | Default |
| -------------------- | ----------------------  | ------- |
| `MATOMO_URL`           | URL to Matomo instance  | -       |
| `MATOMO_TOKEN`         | Access token for Matomo | -       |
| `MATOMO_ID_SITE`       | Site ID                 | 1       |
| `MATOMO_ID_SITES`      | Comma separated id's    | -       |
| `MATOMO_PERIOD`        | Period (day, week etc)  | day     |
| `MATOMO_DATE`          | today, yesterday, 2024-10-02 etc. | - |
| `MATOMO_OUTPUT_FORMAT` | json, xml or tsv.       | tsv     |
| `MATOMO_LIMIT`         | Number of results       | -       |
| `MATOMO_TRUST_SSL_CERT` | Path to local CA       | -       |
| `MATOMO_EXTRA_PARAMS`  | Comma separated list to send in that adds extra query parameters | - |

Note on `MATOMO_TRUST_SSL_CERT` - if you are using mkcert, path should be something like this: `/Users/MYUSER/Library/Application Support/mkcert/rootCA.pem` - check where it stores the CA in your environment.

## Usage

```sh

matomo --help
matomo api --help

```

```sh
export MATOMO_URL=https://mymatomo.instance/index.php
export MATOMO_TOKEN=MYAUTHTOKENFROMMATOMO

matomo api --method MultiSites.getAll --period month --date 2024-08-20 --show_columns nb_actions
```

The method you provide is the API call the tool will do (see your Matomo installation on what API:s you could use)

## Installation

```sh
pip install matomo-cli

```

or

```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/Digitalist-Open-Cloud/Matomo-CLI.git
```

or run as docker image:

```sh
docker run digitalist/matomo-cli matomo --help
```

Docker releases of the cli you can find at [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/digitalist/matomo-cli).

## Known supported API methods

The Matomo API has many methods, and could be extended with plugins, here is a list of methods we know this tool is supporting. Please note, that for now, some methods only works well with json and xml output. And for all them, not all possible options is available in the tool yet.

| Method     |
| ---------- |
| ActivityLog.getEntries |
| API.getMatomoVersion |
| API.getPhpVersion |
| API.getIpFromHeader |
| API.getSettings |
| BotTracker.defaultBots |
| BotTracker.getTop10 |
| MultiSites.getAll |
| PagePerformance.get |
| SitesManager.addSite |
| SitesManager.deleteSite |
| SitesManager.getAllSites |
| SitesManager.getAllSitesId |
| SitesManager.getJavascriptTag |
| _Etc._ |

| `matomo_version_info` | Your version of Matomo | |
| `matomo_php_version_info` | Which PHP version you are running | |
| `matomo_total_users` | Total of users | |
| `matomo_total_non_excluded_users` | With the variable `MATOMO_EXCLUDE_USERS` you can exclude users from this count | |
| `matomo_super_users` | Total number of super users | |
| `matomo_number_of_segments` | Total number of segments | |
| `matomo_number_of_sites` | Total number of sites | |
| `matomo_number_of_actions` | Number of actions today | |
| `matomo_number_of_actions_month` | Number of actions per `month` in `year` | |
| `matomo_archive_start_time` | Archiving started | Part of API Extra Information plugin |
| `matomo_archive_finish_time` | Archiving finished | Part of API Extra Information plugin |
| `matomo_invalidations_total` | Total number of archive invalidations | Part of API Extra Information plugin |
| `matomo_invalidations_queued` | Total number of queued invalidations | Part of API Extra Information plugin |
| `matomo_invalidations_inprogress` | Total number of invalidations in progress | Part of API Extra Information plugin |

The Matomo Exporter is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/digitalist/matomo-exporter).

You can run it with:

```sh
docker run --rm -d -e MATOMO_TOKEN='MyAuthToken' -e MATOMO_URL=https://matomo.url/index.php -p 9110:9110 matomo-exporter
```

Or just test it out from the repo:

```sh
export MATOMO_URL=https://matomo.url/index.php
export MATOMO_TOKEN=MyAuthToken

python3 matomo_cli/prometheus.py
```

### Environment variables for the Prometheus exporter

| Environment Variable | Description             | Default | Required |
| -------------------- | ----------------------  | ------- | -------- |
| MATOMO_URL           | URL to Matomo instance  | -       | Yes      |
| MATOMO_TOKEN         | Access token for Matomo | -       | Yes      |
| MATOMO_EXPORTER_PORT | Port for the exporter   | 9110    | No       |

The plugin Extra Api Information is developed by Digitalist Open Cloud, and could be downloaded from the [Matomo Marketplace](https://plugins.matomo.org/). It provides some extra information from your Matomo instance that is normally not available.

### Deployment example of the Prometheus exporter

You need to have your Matomo URL and you Auth token Base64 encoded into the secret.

```yaml

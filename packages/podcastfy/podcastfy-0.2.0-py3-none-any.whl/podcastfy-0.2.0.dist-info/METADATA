Transforming Multi-Sourced Text into Captivating Multi-Lingual Audio Conversations with GenAI

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1559e70-9cf9-4576-b48b-87e7dad1dd0b

Podcastfy is an open-source Python package that transforms web content, PDFs, and text into engaging, multi-lingual audio conversations using GenAI. 

Unlike UI-based tools focused primarily on note-taking or research synthesis (e.g. NotebookLM ❤️), Podcastfy focuses on the programmatic and bespoke generation of engaging, conversational transcripts and audio from a multitude of text sources therefore enabling customization and scale.

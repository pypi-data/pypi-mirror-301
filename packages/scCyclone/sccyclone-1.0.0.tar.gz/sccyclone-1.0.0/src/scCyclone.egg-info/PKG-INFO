# scCyclone: Single-Cell Cyclone Analysis Package


scCyclone is a comprehensive Python package designed to analyze single-cell full-length transcriptome data. It offers a suite of tools for generating personalized matrices, detecting differential Transcript Usage (DTU) events, identifying differential Promoter Usage (PSI) events, and performing RNA Binding Protein (RBP) analysis.

## Features
Personalized Matrix Generation: Create custom matrices tailored to your specific dataset requirements.
Differential Transcript Usage (DTU) Analysis: Identify variations in transcript usage across different cell populations.
Differential Promoter Usage (PSI) Analysis: Detect differences in promoter usage events within your single-cell data.
RNA Binding Protein (RBP) Analysis: Analyze the binding patterns of RNA binding proteins to understand their role in gene regulation.

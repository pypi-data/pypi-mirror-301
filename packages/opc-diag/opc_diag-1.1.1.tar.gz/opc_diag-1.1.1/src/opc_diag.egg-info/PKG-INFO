*opc-diag* is a command-line application for exploring Microsoft Word, Excel,
and PowerPoint files from Office 2007 and later. Also known as *Office Open
XML*, the structure of these files adheres to the Open Packaging Convention
(OPC), specified by ISO/IEC 29500.

*opc-diag* provides the `opc` command, which allows OPC files to be browsed,
diff-ed, extracted, repackaged, and parts from one to be substituted into
another.

Its primary use is by developers of software that generates and/or
manipulates Microsoft Office documents.

A typical use would be diff-ing a Word file from before and after an operation,
say inserting a paragraph, to identify the specific changes Word made to the
XML. This is handy when one is developing software to do the same without
Word's help:

```bash
$ opc diff before.docx after.docx
```

Another main use is to diagnose an issue causing an Office document to not load
cleanly, typically because the software that generated it has a bug. These
problems can be tedious and often difficult to diagnose without tools like
*opc-diag*, and were the primary motivation for developing it.

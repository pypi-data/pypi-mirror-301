# ``carculator_two_wheeler``

Prospective life cycle assessment of two-wheelers made blazing fast.

A fully parameterized Python model developed by the [Technology Assessment group](https://www.psi.ch/en/ta) of the
[Paul Scherrer Institut](https://www.psi.ch/en) to perform life cycle assessments (LCA) of two-wheelers.
Builds upon the initial LCA model developed by [Cox et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.100).

See [the documentation](https://carculator_two_wheeler.readthedocs.io) for more detail, validation, etc.

### Why ``carculator_two_wheeler``?

``carculator_two_wheeler`` allows yout to:
* produce [life cycle assessment (LCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment) results that include conventional midpoint impact assessment indicators as well cost indicators
* ``carculator_two_wheeler`` uses time- and energy scenario-differentiated background inventories for the future, based on outputs of Integrated Asessment Model [REMIND](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/research/transformation-pathways/models/remind/remind).
* calculate hot pollutant and noise emissions based on a specified driving cycle
* produce error propagation analyzes (i.e., Monte Carlo) while preserving relations between inputs and outputs
* control all the parameters sensitive to the foreground model (i.e., the vehicles) but also to the background model
(i.e., supply of fuel, battery chemistry, etc.)
* and easily export the vehicle models as inventories to be further imported in the [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev) LCA framework or the [SimaPro](https://www.simapro.com/) LCA software.

``carculator_two_wheeler`` integrates well with the [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev) LCA framework.

## Install

``carculator_two_wheeler`` is at an early stage of development and is subject to continuous change and improvement.

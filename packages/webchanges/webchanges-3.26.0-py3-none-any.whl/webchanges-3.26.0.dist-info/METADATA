======================
webchanges |downloads|
======================

**webchanges** checks web content including images, and notifies you via email (or one of many other `supported
services <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html#reporters-list>`__) if a change is detected.
**webchanges** can also check the output of local commands. The notification includes a detail of what has changed
("diff"), with an optional summary generated by AI (BETA).

**webchanges** *anonymously* alerts you of web changes.



Requirements
============
**webchanges** requires |support|.

You should use the latest version of `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ if possible, but older
Python versions are supported for 3 years after being obsoleted by a new major release (3.x). For each major release,
only the latest bug and security fix version (3.x.y) is supported.

For Generative AI summaries (BETA), you need a free `API Key from Google Cloud AI Studio
<https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>`__ (see `here
<https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/differs.html#ai-google>`__).


Installation
============
Install **webchanges** |pypi_version| |format| |status| |security| with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install webchanges


Running in Docker
=================
**webchanges** can be run in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ container; please see `here
<https://github.com/yubiuser/webchanges-docker>`__ for one such implementation.


Documentation |readthedocs|
===========================
The documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/>`__.


Quick Start
============
Initialize
----------

#. Run the following command to create the default ``config.yaml`` (configuration) and ``jobs.yaml`` (jobs) files and
   open an editor to add your `jobs <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jobs.html>`__:

   .. code-block:: bash

      webchanges --edit


#. Run the following command to change the default `configuration
   <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html>`__, e.g. to receive change notifications
   ("`reports <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reporters.html>`__")
   by `email <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reporters.html#smtp>`__ and/or one of many other methods:

   .. code-block:: bash

      webchanges --edit-config


Run
---
To check the sources in your jobs and report on (e.g. display or via email) any changes found from the previous
execution, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   webchanges

**webchanges** does not include a scheduler. We recommend using a system scheduler to automatically run it
periodically:

- On Linux or macOS, you can use cron (if you have never used cron before, see
  `here <https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm>`__); `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru>`__ will build a
  schedule expression for you;
- On macOS, you can use `launchd <https://developer.apple
  .com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html>`__;
- On Windows, you can use the built-in `Windows Task Scheduler
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler>`__.


Code

|coveralls| |issues|

The code and issues tracker are hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/mborsetti/webchanges>`__.


Contributing
============
We welcome any contribution no matter how small, both as pull requests or `issue reports
<https://github.com/mborsetti/webchanges/issues>`__.

More information for code and documentation contributors is `here
<https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html>`__, and our wishlist is `here
<https://github.com/mborsetti/webchanges/blob/main/WISHLIST.md>`__.

Compatibility with and improvements from **urlwatch**
=====================================================

This project is based on code from `urlwatch 2.21
<https://github.com/thp/urlwatch/tree/346b25914b0418342ffe2fb0529bed702fddc01f>`__ dated 30 July 2020. You can
easily upgrade to **webchanges** from the current version of **urlwatch** using the same job and configuration files
(see `here <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migration.html>`__) and benefit from many improvements,
including:

* Summary of changes in plain text using Generative AI, useful for long documents (e.g. legal);
* Depicting changes to an image;
* Element-by-element changes of JSON or XML data;
* Much better `documentation <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/>`__, easing implementation;
* Much clearer to HTML reports, which include:

  * Links that are `clickable <https://pypi.org/project/webchanges/>`__!
  * Retaining of original formatting such as **bolding / headers**, *italics*, :underline:`underlining`, list bullets
    (•) and indentation;
  * Lines that are :additions:`added` and :deletions:`deleted` are clearly highlighted by color and strikethrough,
    and long lines wrap around;
  * Correct rendering by email clients who override stylesheets (e.g. Gmail);
  * Other legibility improvements;

* New filters such as `additions_only <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/diff_filters.html#additions-only>`__,
  which makes it easier to track content that was added without the distractions of the content that was deleted;
* New command line arguments, such as ``--errors`` (to catch jobs that no longer work);
* More reliability and stability, including a ~30 percentage point increase in testing coverage;
* Many other additions, refinements and fixes (see `detailed information
  <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migration.html#upgrade-details>`__).

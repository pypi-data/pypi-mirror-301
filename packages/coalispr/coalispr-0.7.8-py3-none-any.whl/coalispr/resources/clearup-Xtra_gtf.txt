The file 'source/MitochCneoDTagsRecombinationalDNAs.gbk' contains
a) the complete sequence of
serotypeD mitochondrial DNA (as 0:1..33199) from
http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/C.neoformans/files/cnmito.fa.gz
as described in Suppl.Table 2 of
"Mitochondrial Genome Polymorphisms in the Human Pathogenic Fungus 
Cryptococcus neoformans" in Yue Wang and Jianping Xu 2020,
Front. Microbiol., 21 April 2020; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00706 
and b) introduced DNA consisting of epitope tag sequences or CRISPR-Cas9 
plasmid fragments used during transformation.

These sequences have been joined together (i.e. with their annotations)
using the Viewer of the CLC Genomics Workbench (digitalinsights.qiagen.com/).
The annotated sequence was then exported as
1a) genbank file.
1b) fasta sequence file

2) the exported genbank file was translated to gtf with the share/genbank2gtf.py
script to enable display in the bedgraph browser and is joined with the
`Unspecific` gtf during browsing and with the main gtf for mapping.

3) created a 'source/MitochCneoDTagsRecombinationalDNAs-length.txt' file.

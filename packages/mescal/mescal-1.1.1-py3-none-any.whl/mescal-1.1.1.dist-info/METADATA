## What is _mescal_?

_mescal_ is a Python package for the creation and management of life-cycle inventory databases and metrics derived from life-cycle assessment, to be integrated in decision-making tools such as energy system models.

_mescal_ is a specialized package of the [Brightway Software Framework](https://brightway.dev/), mainly relying on the [bw2calc](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-calc) and [wurst](https://github.com/polca/wurst) Python packages.

_mescal_ was designed for all researchers and modellers aiming to include life-cycle assessment (LCA) in their work, but who are not necessarily LCA experts. Mescal is usually used within [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).


![workflow of the mescal methodology](docs/pics/workflow.png "workflow")

LCI datasets are taken from ecoinvent and possibly other sources if some of the ESM technologies are not covered in the ecoinvent database, e.g., [_premise_](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S136403212200226X) additional inventories. These LCI datasets are mapped to the ESM technologies and resources. This is followed by operations of regionalization, databases harmonization, double-counting removal, and life-cycle impact assessment. LCA indicators are then ready to be integrated to the ESM.

## How to use _mescal_?

You can follow this [example notebook](https://github.com/matthieu-str/mescal/blob/master/examples/tutorial.ipynb) to learn how to use _mescal_.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or more** 
- Licence for [ecoinvent 3](https://ecoinvent.org/). The ecoinvent database is not included in this package. You may also check ecoinvent's [GDPR & EULA](https://ecoinvent.org/gdpr-eula/). 

## Installation

You can install _mescal_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install mescal
```

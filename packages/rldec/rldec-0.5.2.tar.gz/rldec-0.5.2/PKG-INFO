           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

This project is an implementation of the RLDec decomposition approach as described in the paper 
"Extracting Microservices from Monolithic Systems
using Deep Reinforcement Learning" [[1]](#1).

RLDec is a decomposition tool that analyzes the source code of a monolithic Java application and suggests the 
recommended microservices for each class in the system using a Deep Reinforcement Learning based method. 

The RLDec implementation contains the logic for generating the decomposition of the monolithic application. 
However, the analysis of the source code has to be done by another tool. This implementation is compatible with 
the packages [decomp-java-analysis-service](https://github.com/khaledsellami/decomp-java-analysis-service) and [decomp-parsing-service](https://github.com/khaledsellami/decomp-parsing-service.git) that handle the static analysis part of the process.
Otherwise, it is possible to use your own tool but the input to RLDec has to conform to the required types and structure.



# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

The main requirements are:
* Python 3.10 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/khaledsellami/decomp-rldec.git
   ```
2. Install rldec as a Python module:
   ```sh
   cd decomp-rldec/
   pip install -e .
   ```
   Or you can install only the required libraries:
   ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

## Preparing the input data
In order to use RLDec, the source code of the monolithic application has to be analyzed and parsed to extract the structural and semantic dependencies as described in the paper. You can use our anaysis and parsing tools or use your own tools to generate the required data:
### Using the analysis and parsing tools:
The details of how to use these tools and generate the analysis results with them can be found in their corresponding repositories: [decomp-java-analysis-service](https://github.com/khaledsellami/decomp-java-analysis-service) and [decomp-parsing-service](https://github.com/khaledsellami/decomp-parsing-service.git).

### Using a third-party analysis tool:

The folder that contains the static analysis results must contain the following strcuture:
```text
   path_to_my_data/
   └── name_of_the_app/
      ├── class_word_count.parquet: a NxM matrix representing the Bag-of-Word vectors of each class where N is the number of classes and M is the size of the vocabulary
      └── class_interactions.parquet: a NxM matrix representing the dependencies from each class to the others (calls, inheritance, field usage, etc) where N is the number of classes 
```


## Training the model
The training of the model can be done using the following command (example with the combsequential method):
```sh
   python main.py train your_app_name --data /path/to/data --output /path/to/save/model --config /path/to/config --approach combsequential --model model_name
```

The configuration file contains the hyperparameters of the approach. Examples of default configurations can be found in the [default_configs](rldec%2Fdefault_configs) folder.

You can also use the following command to get more details about the training:
```sh
   python main.py train --help
```

## Decomposing the monolithic application using the trained model
The decomposition of the monolithic application can be done using the following command:
```sh
   python main.py decompose your_app_name --model model_name --output /path/to/save/decomposition --path /path/to/saved/model
```
The output will be a JSON file that contains the decomposition of the monolithic application in addition to some metadata.


# Advanced usage
## Using the analysis and parsing tools as gRPC services
The analysis and parsing tools can be used as gRPC services. In this case, you do not need to prepare the data for RLDec. You can use the following command to train the model:
```sh
   python main.py train your_app_name --output /path/to/output --repo /path/or/github/link/to/source/code
``` 

## Using RLDec as a gRPC server
RLDec can be used as a gRPC server and its API can be consumed to train and generate the decompositions. You can start the server using the following command:
```sh
   python main.py start
```

For more details about the API, you can inspect the protobuf file "rldec.proto" in the [proto/rldec](protos%2Frldec) folder.

## Using RLDec as a Python module
RLDec can be used as a Python module and customized to fit your needs. For examples to how to use the module, you can inspect the files in the [jobs](jobs) folder.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
* Improve the documentation of this module
* Integrate the CombFlattened approach into the CLI and Server
* Add an option to use the parsing service as a Python module
* Update the default configurations to include the new approaches paths

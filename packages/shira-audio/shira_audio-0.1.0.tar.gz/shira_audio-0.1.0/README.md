### A simple audio search/retrieval library. (wip)

This is the audio version of [ripple](https://github.com/kelechi-c/ripple_net).
It's meant to be an **_neural_ encoded** version of [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com/), but might just be for small scale/local usage.

#### Methodology
It's basically a **semantic search library for audio**.

The local audio data/files are indexed and embeddings are generated(with CLAP), 
then a **FAISS** vector index is created.\
The files are retrieved based on **cosine similarity** between embeddings.

This process makes use of contrastively pretrained audio-language model, **CLAP**(like **OpenAI CLIP** for audio), 
specifically LAION's **[laion/larger_clap_music_and_speech](https://huggingface.co/laion/larger_clap_music_and_speech)** checkpoint/model

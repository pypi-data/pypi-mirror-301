  """
  Scan a function over leading array axes while carrying along state.

  The `Haskell-like type signature`_ in brief is

  .. code-block:: haskell

    scan :: (c -> a -> (c, b)) -> c -> [a] -> (c, [b])

  where for any array type specifier ``t``, ``[t]`` represents the type with an additional
  leading axis, and if ``t`` is a pytree (container) type with array leaves then ``[t]``
  represents the type with the same pytree structure and corresponding leaves
  each with an additional leading axis.

  When the type of ``xs`` (denoted `a` above) is an array type or None, and the type
  of ``ys`` (denoted `b` above) is an array type, the semantics of :func:`~scan` are
  given roughly by this Python implementation::

    def scan(f, init, xs, length=None):
      if xs is None:
        xs = [None] * length
      carry = init
      ys = []
      for x in xs:
        carry, y = f(carry, x)
        ys.append(y)
      return carry, np.stack(ys)

  Unlike that Python version, both ``xs`` and ``ys`` may be arbitrary pytree
  values, and so multiple arrays can be scanned over at once and produce multiple
  output arrays. ``None`` is actually a special case of this, as it represents an
  empty pytree.

  Also unlike that Python version, :func:`~scan` is a JAX primitive and is
  lowered to a single WhileOp. That makes it useful for reducing
  compilation times for JIT-compiled functions, since native Python
  loop constructs in an :func:`~jax.jit` function are unrolled, leading to large
  XLA computations.

  Finally, the loop-carried value ``carry`` must hold a fixed shape and dtype
  across all iterations (and not just be consistent up to NumPy rank/shape
  broadcasting and dtype promotion rules, for example). In other words, the type
  ``c`` in the type signature above represents an array with a fixed shape and
  dtype (or a nested tuple/list/dict container data structure with a fixed
  structure and arrays with fixed shape and dtype at the leaves).

  Args:
    f: a Python function to be scanned of type ``c -> a -> (c, b)``, meaning
      that ``f`` accepts two arguments where the first is a value of the loop
      carry and the second is a slice of ``xs`` along its leading axis, and that
      ``f`` returns a pair where the first element represents a new value for
      the loop carry and the second represents a slice of the output.
    init: an initial loop carry value of type ``c``, which can be a scalar,
      array, or any pytree (nested Python tuple/list/dict) thereof, representing
      the initial loop carry value. This value must have the same structure as
      the first element of the pair returned by ``f``.
    xs: the value of type ``[a]`` over which to scan along the leading axis,
      where ``[a]`` can be an array or any pytree (nested Python
      tuple/list/dict) thereof with consistent leading axis sizes.
    length: optional integer specifying the number of loop iterations, which
      must agree with the sizes of leading axes of the arrays in ``xs`` (but can
      be used to perform scans where no input ``xs`` are needed).
    reverse: optional boolean specifying whether to run the scan iteration
      forward (the default) or in reverse, equivalent to reversing the leading
      axes of the arrays in both ``xs`` and in ``ys``.
    unroll: optional positive int or bool specifying, in the underlying
      operation of the scan primitive, how many scan iterations to unroll within
      a single iteration of a loop. If an integer is provided, it determines how
      many unrolled loop iterations to run within a single rolled iteration of
      the loop. If a boolean is provided, it will determine if the loop is
      completely unrolled (i.e. `unroll=True`) or left completely unrolled (i.e.
      `unroll=False`).
    pbar: optional :class:`~.ProgressBar` instance to display the progress
      of the scan operation.

  Returns:
    A pair of type ``(c, [b])`` where the first element represents the final
    loop carry value and the second element represents the stacked outputs of
    the second output of ``f`` when scanned over the leading axis of the inputs.

# There's several tricks happening here to work around various limitations of JAX.
# (Also see https://github.com/google/jax/issues/2139#issuecomment-1039293633)
# 1. `unvmap_any` prior to using `lax.cond`. JAX has a problem in that vmap-of-cond
#    is converted to a `lax.select`, which executes both branches unconditionally.
#    Thus writing this naively, using a plain `lax.cond`, will mean the loop always
#    runs to `max_steps` when executing under vmap. Instead we run (only) until every
#    batch element has finished.
# 2. Treating in-place updates specially in the body_fun. Specifically we need to
#    `lax.select` the update-to-make, not the updated buffer. This is because the
#    latter instead results in XLA:CPU failing to determine that the buffer can be
#    updated in-place, and instead it makes a copy. c.f. JAX issue #8192.
#    This is done through the extra `inplace` argument provided to `body_fun`.
# 3. The use of the `@jax.checkpoint` decorator. Backpropagation through a
#    `bounded_while_loop` will otherwise run in θ(max_steps) time, rather than
#    θ(number of steps actually taken).
# 4. The use of `base`. In theory `base=2` is optimal at run time, as it implies the
#    fewest superfluous operations. In practice this implies quite deep recursion in
#    the construction of the bounded while loop, and this slows down the jaxpr
#    creation and the XLA compilation. We choose `base=16` as a reasonable-looking
#    compromise between compilation time and run time.

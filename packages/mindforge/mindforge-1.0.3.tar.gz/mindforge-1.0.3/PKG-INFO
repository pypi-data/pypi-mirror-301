# Mindforge Client

[mindforge.ai](https://mindforge.ai)

This is a Python client for interacting with the Mindforge API. It provides a simple interface to connect to the Mindforge server, send messages, and receive various types of events.

## Installation

To install the Mindforge client, use pip:

```bash
pip install mindforge
```

## Usage

Create a MindforgeClient:

```python
from mindforge import MindforgeClient, MindforgeServerEventType

api_key = "your-api-key"
client = MindforgeClient(api_key)
```

To use this client, you'll need a Mindforge API key. You can create keys in the dashboard.

### Open a websocket connection

To connect to the Mindforge server:

```python
character_id = "your-character-id"
conversation_id = "optional-conversation-id"
client.connect(character_id, conversation_id)
```

### Sending messages and audio data

To send a text message to the server:

```python
client.send_message("Hello, Mindforge!")
```

To send audio data to the server:

```python
client.send_audio_data("base64-encoded-audio-data")
```

### Receiving data

You can listen for various events emitted by the client:

```python
def on_npc_message(content):
  print("Received NPC message:", content)

def on_npc_action(content):
  print("Received NPC action:", content)

def on_npc_live_message_chunk(content):
  print("Received NPC live message chunk:", content)

def on_npc_live_message(content):
  print("Received complete NPC live message:", content)

def on_npc_audio_data(content):
  print("Received NPC audio data:", content)

def on_player_transcribed_message_chunk(content):
  print("Received player transcribed message chunk:", content)

def on_player_transcribed_message(content):
  print("Received complete player transcribed message:", content)

def on_server_error(content):
  print("Server error:", content)

def on_close():
  print("Connection closed")

client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.NPCMessage, on_npc_message)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.NPCAction, on_npc_action)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.NPCLiveMessageChunk, on_npc_live_message_chunk)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.NPCLiveMessage, on_npc_live_message)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.NPCAudioData, on_npc_audio_data)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.PlayerTranscribedMessageChunk, on_player_transcribed_message_chunk)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.PlayerTranscribedMessage, on_player_transcribed_message)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.ServerError, on_server_error)
client.on(MindforgeServerEventType.Close, on_close)
```

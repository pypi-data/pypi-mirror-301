This file contains the core code to perform propagation via phase space. The 
function run_psprop(...) is the intended interface for users who have already
acquired a Mutual Optical Intensity (MOI) function. 

The algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. Rewrite the MOI using the Wigner basis
2. Calculate the Wigner Distribution Function, or Phase Space Density (PSD) 
   in the present context, by a 1D Fourier transform.
3. Propagate the PSD via a shearing transformation.
4. Calculate the propagated MOI (still using the Wigner basis). 

Extraction of the wave function from the propagated MOI occurs by taking a 
particular cross section of the propagated MOI under the Wigner basis. See 
extract_wf(...) for more details.

The term Wigner distribution is here used to refer to any distribution which 
consists of one Fourier component and one real space component. The term 
phase space density is a kind of Wigner distribution specific to the optical 
context, which has the unique property of free space propagation via shearing.

# mega-pack-pbf-parser
 Parse a BB project's PBF contents and output data in various formats

Goals

1. create a Mega Pack project with all available packs (add to download area?)
2. create script(s) to generate csv and PDF with details (song names, tempo, total songs per pack, total songs for Mega Pack)
3. create a package for easy installation

github repository description: Parse a BB project's PBF contents and output data in various formats

Scripting

Output
- csv listing of all content
- convert csv to PDF
- create HTML from csv? (try chat GPT or github or Microsoft)

Process Mega Project "SONGS" folder

This folder has a folder for each PBF. 
Each PBF folder has a cvs file with a listing of all songs
Create a database of songs to avoid having to parse the project folder to create PDF or HTML?

** I probably need a csv or database of pack names and PBF names (e.g. GM_Doom -> Doom)

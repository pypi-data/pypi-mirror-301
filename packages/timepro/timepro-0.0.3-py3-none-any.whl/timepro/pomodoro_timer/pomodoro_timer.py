    """
    A class to implement the Pomodoro Technique for time management.

    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer 
    to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, 
    separated by short breaks.

    Attributes:
        work_duration (int): Duration of work session in minutes. Defaults to 25 minutes.
        break_duration (int): Duration of break session in minutes. Defaults to 5 minutes.
        long_break_duration (int): Duration of long break session in minutes. Defaults to 15 minutes.
        sessions_before_long_break (int): Number of work sessions before a long break. Defaults to 4.
        sessions_completed (int): Number of completed work sessions.
        timer_running (bool): Status of the timer (running or not).

            sessions_completed (int): The number of work sessions completed so far.

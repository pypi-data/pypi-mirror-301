We start with the least accurate model. For each more accurate model, we accept it if the increase in estimated cost divided by the increase in estimated accuracy is no more than this value divided by 10%, up to the upper limit specified above. Lower values will try to keep the cost as low as possible, higher values will approach the cost limit to increase accuracy. 0 means unlimited.

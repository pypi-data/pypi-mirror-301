# NeuroM

NeuroM is a Python toolkit for the analysis and processing of neuron morphologies.

## Documentation

NeuroM documentation is built and hosted on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/).

* [latest snapshot](http://neurom.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* [latest release](http://neurom.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)

## Migration to v2 or v3 versions

Refer to [the doc page](https://neurom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration.html) on this topic.

## Reporting issues

Issues should be reported to the
[NeuroM github repository issue tracker](https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroM/issues).
The ability and speed with which issues can be resolved depends on how complete and
succinct the report is. For this reason, it is recommended that reports be accompanied
with
* A minimal but self-contained code sample that reproduces the issue. Minimal means no
  code that is irrelevant to the issue should be included. Self-contained means it should
  be possible to run the code without modifications and reproduce the problem.
* The observed and expected output and/or behaviour. If the issue is an error, the python
  error stack trace is extremely useful.
* The commit ID of the version used. This is particularly important if reporting an error
  from an older version of NeuroM.
* If reporting a regression, the commit ID of the change that introduced the problem
* If the issue depends on data, a data sample which reproduces the problem should be
  up-loaded. But check first whether the error can be reproduced with any of the data
  samples available in the `tests/data` directory.

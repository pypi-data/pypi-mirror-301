Features
--------

The following colour checker detection algorithms are implemented:

-   Segmentation
-   Machine learning inference via `Ultralytics YOLOv8 <https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics>`__

    -   The model is published on `HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/colour-science/colour-checker-detection-models>`__,
        and was trained on a purposely constructed `dataset <https://huggingface.co/datasets/colour-science/colour-checker-detection-dataset>`__.
    -   The model has only been trained on *ColorChecker Classic 24* images and
        will not work with *ColorChecker Nano* or *ColorChecker SG* images.
    -   Inference is performed by a script licensed under the terms of the
        *GNU Affero General Public License v3.0* as it uses the
        *Ultralytics YOLOv8* API which is incompatible with the
        *BSD-3-Clause*.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Various usage examples are available from the
`examples directory <https://github.com/colour-science/colour-checker-detection/tree/master/colour_checker_detection/examples>`__.

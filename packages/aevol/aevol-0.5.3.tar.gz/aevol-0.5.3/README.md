Python Package for Aevol
========================

This is a Python Package for Aevol (https://aevol.fr/).

It contains data models, code for creating visualizations and command-line scripts to be used with
aevol-generated data.

Visualize aevol-generated data
-----------------------------

This package comes with a command line script to create graphical views from aevol-generated data.

It takes as input the "ui-output" files generated by aevol_run (see options `--ui-output-dir` 
and `--ui-output-frequency`)

```sh
$ aevol_ui_build_views -e environment.json -g grid_000000100.json -i indiv_000000100.json
```

You need not provide all these files, `build_views` will build all the views it can with the provided data.


Contributing
------------

Probably the easiest way of trying out any modification you would like to make to this package is to install an **editable** version of the package.

This can be done by running the following command from the topmost directory of the project (where this README sits):

```sh
$ pip install --editable .
```

## Typing stubs for gevent

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`gevent`](https://github.com/gevent/gevent) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`gevent`.

This version of `types-gevent` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `gevent==24.10.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/gevent. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.

[`7ccc587afb50d3b7f77628292a8136b4c1e70735`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/7ccc587afb50d3b7f77628292a8136b4c1e70735) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.2, pyright 1.1.383, and

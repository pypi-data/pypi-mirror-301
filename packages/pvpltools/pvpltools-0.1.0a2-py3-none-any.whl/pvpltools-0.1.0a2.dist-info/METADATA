# PV Performance Labs Tools for Python

Useful tools for photovoltaics and beyond!

Latest news
-----------
2024-02-13: More proof that these tools are useful!  The module efficiency functions were put to good use in [this new study by Lelia Deville and her colleagues][101]: 

[101]: https://doi.org/10.1002/pip.3763

2021-10-17: New module `power_conversion`, which introduces a function for calculating the ADR inverter model coeffients and more.

2021-08-11: The IEC 61853 spectral factor function has a new option `integration_limit`.  Explanations are provided in the doc string. 

2020-12-02: Seven models and a model fitting function are now available, and the example code shows how to fit them to data and calculate rms error for comparisons. And of course there are nice graphs.


Contents
--------

A quick overview:

- pvpltools/
	- power_conversion.py (work in progress)
		- functions related to PV inverters and other power conversion devices
		
	- module_efficiency.py
		- a collection of models for PV module efficiency (at MPP)
		- includes the new ADR model and others
        - also includes a model fitting function
        - demonstrations in a Jupyter Notebook in examples directory
	
	- iec61853.py
		- reliable functions for Climate-Specific Energy Rating (CSER) calculations
		- incident angle modifier for direct and diffuse irradiance
		- spectral correction/mismatch factor
		- module operating temperature
		- efficiency matrix interpolation/extrapolation

	- dataplusmeta.py
		- a simple way to pack data and essential meta-data into a single text file

	- data/
		- nrel_mpert/
			- module measurements, model parameters and other data in DataPlusMeta style

	- tests/
		- test files for the functions in the main module, to be run with `pytest`

- examples/
    - module_efficiency_demo.ipynb
    - dataplusmeta_demo.py

- docs/
	- sphinx project files and documentation auxiliary files, user guide, etc.

Development status
------------------

2020-12-02
- The new module `module_efficiency.py` now contains functions for:
    - the new ADR model
    - HEY
    - MotherPV
    - PVGIS
    - MPM5
    - MPM6
    - bilinear
    - fitting any of the models to measurements

2020-02-29

- The main building blocks for the Energy Rating calculation are complete.
- A higher level function of example script may be coming some day.

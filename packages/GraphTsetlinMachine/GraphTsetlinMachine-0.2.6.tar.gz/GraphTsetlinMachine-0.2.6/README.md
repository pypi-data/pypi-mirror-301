## Tutorial 

In this tutorial, you create graphs for the Noisy XOR problem and then train and test the Graph Tsetlin Machine on these. You have four kinds of graphs, shown below:

</p>

Each node has one of two properties: _'A'_ or _'B'_. If both of the nodes in a graph have the same property, the graph is labeled _Y=0_. Otherwise, it is labeled _Y=1_. The task of the Graph Tsetlin Machine is to assign the correct label to each type of graph, when the labels used for training are noisy.

### Initialization

Start by creating the training graphs using the _Graphs_ class:
```bash
graphs_train = Graphs(
    10000,
    symbols = ['A', 'B'],
    hypervector_size = 32,
    hypervector_bits = 2
)
```
You initialize the class as follows:
- *Number of Graphs.* The first number sets how many graphs you are going to create. Here, you prepare for creating _10,000_ graphs.

- *Symbols.* Next, you find the symbols 'A' and 'B'. You use these symbols to assign properties to the nodes of the graphs. You can define as many symbols as you like. For the XOR problem, you only need two.

- *Vector Symbolic Representation (Hypervectors).* You also decide how large hypervectors you would like to use to store the symbols. Larger hypervectors room more symbols. Since you only have two symbols, set the size to _32_. Finally, you decide how many bits to use for representing each symbol. Use _2_ bits for this tutorial. You then get _32*31/2 = 496_ unique bit pairs - plenty of space for two symbols!
  
- *Generation and Compilation.* The generation and compilation of hypervectors happen automatically during initialization of your _Graphs_ object,  using [sparse distributed codes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/917565).

### Adding the Nodes

The next step is to set how many nodes you want in each of the _10,000_ graphs you are building. For the NoisyXOR problem, each graph has two nodes:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
    graphs_train.set_number_of_graph_nodes(graph_id, 2)
```
After doing that, you prepare for adding the nodes:
```bash
graphs_train.prepare_node_configuration()
```
You add the two nodes to the graphs as follows, giving them one outgoing edge each:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
  number_of_outgoing_edges = 1

  graphs_train.add_graph_node(graph_id, 'Node 1', number_of_outgoing_edges)

  graphs_train.add_graph_node(graph_id, 'Node 2', number_of_outgoing_edges)
```

### Adding the Edges

```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
    edge_type = "Plain"
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_edge(graph_id, 'Node 1', 'Node 2', edge_type)
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_edge(graph_id, 'Node 2', 'Node 1', edge_type)
```

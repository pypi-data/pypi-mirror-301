## Overview

Tea Logger is a simple logging package for Python.

### Quick Start

Install the `tealogger` package, available on
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

```bash
pip install tealogger
```

Import the `tealogger` package to use.

```python
import tealogger

# Set the logging level (optional)
tealogger.setLevel(tealogger.DEBUG)

tealogger.warning("WARNING: Message")
```

### Level

From high (`CRITICAL`) to low (`DEBUG`).

* `CRITICAL` = 50
* `FATAL` = `CRITICAL` (Do not use, use `CRITICAL` instead)
* `ERROR` = 40
* `WARNING` = 30
* `WARN` = `WARNING` (Deprecated, use `WARNING` instead)
* `INFO` = 20
* `DEBUG` = 10
* `NOTSET` = 0
* `EXCEPTION`

## Note

### Child Logger

When creating a child logger, if there are no handler(s) added, it will
inherit the handle(s) from the parent. But if the parent logger itself
is set to a higher level, the higher level gets respected. Since the
parent handler(s) attached to the parent logger only output if the
parent logger allows it.

              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Substra is an open source federated learning (FL) software. It enables the training and validation of machine learning models on distributed datasets. It provides a flexible Python interface and a web application to run federated learning training at scale. This specific repository is about SubstraFL the high-level federated learning Python library based on the low-level [Substra](https://github.com/Substra/substra) python library. SubstraFL is used to run complex federated learning experiments at scale.

Substra's main usage is in production environments. It has already been deployed and used by hospitals and biotech companies (see the [MELLODDY](https://www.melloddy.eu/) project for instance). Substra can also be used on a single machine to perform FL simulations and debug code.

Substra was originally developed by [Owkin](https://owkin.com/) and is now hosted by the [Linux Foundation for AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/). Today Owkin is the main contributor to Substra.

Join the discussion on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/substra-workspace/shared_invite/zt-1fqnk0nw6-xoPwuLJ8dAPXThfyldX8yA) and [subscribe here](https://lists.lfaidata.foundation/g/substra-announce/join) to our newsletter.

## How to install

```sh
pip install substrafl
```

## To start using Substra

Have a look at our [documentation](https://docs.substra.org/).

Try out our [MNIST example](https://docs.substra.org/en/stable/substrafl_doc/examples/index.html#example-to-get-started-using-the-pytorch-interface).

## Support

If you need support, please either raise an issue on Github or ask on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/substra-workspace/shared_invite/zt-1fqnk0nw6-xoPwuLJ8dAPXThfyldX8yA).



## Contributing

Substra warmly welcomes any contribution. Feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request.

## How to test

Install `substrafl` in editable mode with developper dependencies.
In addition, install `substra` and `substra-tools` in editable mode.
It is recommended to install all the libraries in a Python virtual env.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Substra/substrafl.git
pip install -e "substrafl[dev]"
git clone git@github.com:Substra/substra.git
pip install -e substra
git clone git@github.com:Substra/substra-tools.git
pip install -e substra-tools
```

Now you can use the following command from `subtrafl` top level directory to run tests:

```sh
cd substrafl
make test-subprocess
```

### Running advanced test suites

Substra can be used in three different modes: using Python subprocesses (`subprocess`),
 using Docker (`docker`) and using Kubernetes (`remote`).

The command `make test-subprocess` runs the test suite in subprocess mode. It's lightweight and perfect to start.

To test with the Docker mode, you will need Docker installed and running on your machine.
If necessary, install it using [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

The following command runs the test suites in subprocess and Docker mode:

```sh
make test-local
``

Please be warned that some of these tests are slow and the whole test suite might require a couple hours to complete.

To try out a local deployment with Kubernetes, please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.substra.org/en/stable/contributing/local-deployment.html) provided in the documentation.
The following command runs the remote tests:

```sh
make test-remote
```

## How to generate the changelog

The changelog is managed with [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
To add a new entry in the changelog, add a file in the `changes` folder. The file name should have the following structure:
`<unique_id>.<change_type>`.
The `unique_id` is a unique identifier, we currently use the PR number.
The `change_type` can be of the following types: `added`, `changed`, `removed`, `fixed`.

To generate the changelog (for example during a release), use the following command (you must have the dev dependencies installed):

```
towncrier build --version=<x.y.z>
```

You can use the `--draft` option to see what would be generated without actually writing to the changelog (and without removing the fragments).


# Appendix

## Building the documentation

The API documentation is generated from the SubstraFL repository thanks to the auto doc module.
It is automatically built by <https://github.com/Substra/substra-documentation> and integrated into the general documentation [here](https://docs.substra.org/).

You can build the API documentation locally to see the changes made by your PR.

### Requirements

You need to have substrafl.dev installed on your machine and some extra requirements. From the SubstraFL repo:

```sh
pip install -e '.[dev]'
cd docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build

You can build the documentation to see if your changes are well taken into account.
From the ./docs folder :

```sh
make clean html
```

No warning should be thrown by this command.

Then open the `./docs/_build/index.html` file to see the results.

You can also generate the documentation live so each of your changes are taken into account on the fly:

```sh
make livehtml
```

NB: Sometimes `make livehtml` does not take changes into account so running the `make html` command in parallel might be needed.

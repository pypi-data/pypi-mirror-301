Pre planning:
* ControlInterface should be instantiated with minimum config to connect to central controller (if any). DummyControlInterface has not central controller
* ControlInterface should first authenticate with the remote (if necessary)
* ControlInterface should perform any ready-checks then report itself as ready to the remote
* ControlInterface should wait until the remote confirms to start the shard. Remote is also responsible for providing token and shard id
* ControlInterface should then instantiate and start a client instance
* All configuration, including database connection information, is read from the controller
* The bot should be able to connect to the database once it has relevant connection details without using the controller each time.
* The ControlInterface is responsible for adding the global /config command to a client
* The schema and migration events will remain in the client, however, the client will no longer call await self.db.connection.run_sync(self.db.base.metadata.create_all)
  * The controller is now responsible for creating database schema. The remote may request that a shard create the schema or not.

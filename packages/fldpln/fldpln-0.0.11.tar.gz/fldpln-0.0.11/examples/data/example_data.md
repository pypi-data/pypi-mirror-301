# Example Data

The notebooks use the Wildcat Creek as an example to introduce the FLDPLN model and to map the 2018 Labor Day flood inundation. [Wildcat Creek data](https://itprdkarsap.home.ku.edu/download/fldpln/wildcat_10m_3dep.zip) is available as a zip file on KU KBS-KARS server as it's too large to be put on Github. The zip file contains DEM and its derivatives, segment shapefiles, gauge Excel file and a reference flood inundation map.

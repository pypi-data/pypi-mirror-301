Welcome to xtremes!
===================

**xtremes** is a Python library for various utilities useful in Extreme Value Statistics. It is created within the ClimXtreme project 
and will provide supplementary code and simulations for the papers yet to come.

So far, it has one submodule of larger importance
```python
   import xtremes.HighOrderStatistics as hos
```
It covers auxiliary functions to support the paper [add title], also see the repository containing supplementary material https://github.com/haufse/Top-Two [to be made public]


Installation:
-------------
```bash

   (.venv) $ pip install xtremes
```
Also view it on PyPi, https://pypi.org/project/xtremes/.

Documentation:
--------------
Check out <https://xtremes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> for further information!

Note:
-----
   This project will be updated throughout the project phase. It will be used to provide code supporting theoretical advances.

    """
    Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both
    recurring and one-time purchases of products. Products help you track inventory
    or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical
    goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options
    should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without
    having to change your provisioning scheme.

    For example,
    you might have a single "gold" product that has
    prices for $10/month, $100/year, and â‚¬9 once.

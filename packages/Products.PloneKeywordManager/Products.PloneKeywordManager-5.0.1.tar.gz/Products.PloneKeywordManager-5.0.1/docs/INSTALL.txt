Products.PloneKeywordManager Installation
=========================================

This package is designed as a Plone add-on package.

https://docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installing_addons.html

Using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

  * Add ``Products.PloneKeywordManager`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.PloneKeywordManager [Levenshtein]

  * If you want Products.PloneKeywordManager to be a dependency of a module,
    update the setup.py of this module, e.g.:

    install_requires=[
          ...
          'Products.PloneKeywordManager[Levenshtein]',
          ...
      ],

  * If you get troubles with python-Levenshtein install, you may remove the
    [Levenshtein] extra.

  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

Once installed, restart your plone instance and visit Site Setup ( /@@overview-controlpanel)
From there, open the Add-ons Panel, select "Keyword Manager" and click 'install'

Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can also be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product**.

For that, move (or symlink) the ``PloneKeywordManager`` folder of this project
(``Products.PloneKeywordManager/Products/PloneKeywordManager``) into the ``Products`` directory of
the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

You can also skip the ZCML slug if you install this package the **Zope 2
Product** way.

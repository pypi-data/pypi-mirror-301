# SGN-LIGO

SGN-LIGO is set of extensions to the core library `sgn`, that includes functionality
specific to LIGO Scientific Collaboration data analysis. This page is for documenatation
of the `sgnligo` package, but there is a family of libraries that extend the functionality of SGN
in other ways, including:

- [`sgn`](https://docs.ligo.org/greg/sgn/): Base library for SGN
- [`sgn-ts`](https://git.ligo.org/greg/sgn-ts): TimeSeries utilities for SGN
- [`sgn-try`](https://git.ligo.org/greg/sgn-try): Process monitoring and alerting utilities for SGN

## Installation

To install SGN-LIGO, simply run:

```bash
pip install sgn-ligo
```

More SGN-LIGO-specific documentation coming soon.

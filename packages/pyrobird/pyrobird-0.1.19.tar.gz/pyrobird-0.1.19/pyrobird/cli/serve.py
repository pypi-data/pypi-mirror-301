    Start the server that serves Firebird frontend and can communicate with it.

    This server allows firebird to work with local files and local file system as
    well as to complement frontend features such as open xrootd files, etc.

    This command initializes the Flask server with specific settings for file handling
    and cross-origin resource sharing, tailored to operational and security requirements.

    Examples:
      - Start server with default settings, Firebird works with files in current directory:
          fbd serve
      - Enable unrestricted file downloads (absolute paths allowed) and CORS:
          fbd serve --allow-any-file --allow-cors
      - Set, where firebird will take files from
          fbd serve --work-path=/home/username/datafiles
        Now if you set file local://filename.root in Firebird UI,
        the file /home/username/datafiles/filename.root will be opened

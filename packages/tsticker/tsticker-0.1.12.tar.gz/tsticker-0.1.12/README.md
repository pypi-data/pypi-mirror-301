## üìò Overview

`tsticker` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the creation and management of Telegram
stickers. It automatically adjusts image sizes and suggests appropriate emojis based on image names. The tool supports
both static and animated stickers (in webm format).

Just by adding or deleting files, you can easily update the contents of your sticker pack - making it incredibly
user-friendly!

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No Support for Tgs Stickers**  | `tgs` format is not supported for this cli.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Rate Limiting**                | Each request is throttled to 2 seconds to avoid being blocked by Telegram.                                                                                                        |
| **Limited Emoji Auto-Selection** | Automatic emoji selection may not work optimally for all languages, primarily supported for English. check `github@telegram_sticker_utils:telegram_sticker_utils/core/rules.json` |
| **Rate Limits**                  | Avoid excessive uploads in a short period to prevent Telegram from throttling your bot's actions.                                                                                 |
| **Security**                     | Keep your bot token secure. Stickers can only be managed through your bot or the official @Stickers bot by the sticker pack creator.                                              |

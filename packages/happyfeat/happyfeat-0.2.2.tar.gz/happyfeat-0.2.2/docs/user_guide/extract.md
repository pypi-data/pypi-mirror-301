# Using HappyFeat

## Extracting the features (left panel)

This step allows to extract relevant data from EEG signals, before using this data to analyse the 
spectral/connectivity features and select them for training the classifier.

Available signal files are shown in the top list of this panel. This list is automatically updated from the `signals` folder of the current workspace. 

!!! tip 
    You can either manually add signal files in your OS file system, or use the generated OpenViBE scenario `sc1-monitor-acq.xml` in the current workspace folder, if in the context of a BCI experiment. This scenario is automatically set up (in the workspace creation step) to write EEG signal files in the correct `signals` folder.
	
!!! note
	As of today, the only supported format for signal files is **OpenViBE**'s `.ov` format. Work is ongoing to add support for other formats widespread in the EEG/BCI community (e.g. GDF)

From this list, select one or multiple signal files you're interested in analyzing. Enter the extraction parameters (Epoch of interest, epoch offset from stimulation, autoregressive model order...). 

!!! tip
    A list of (non-editable) experimental parameters (set up when creating the workspace) is provided as a reminder.

Click on **"Extract Feature and Trials"**. EEG signal files (or **runs**) for which the extraction step has been performed appear in the lists of the central and right part of the GUI, meaning they are now available for the analysis ([visualization](visualize.md) and [training](train.md) steps).

!!! note
    * Note that processing times are highly dependent on the extraction parameters and the selected metric. As a rule of thumb, Connectivity features are much slower to compute than PSD ones, and using a higher AR order and/or higher number of estimations (shorter windows, higher amount of overlap) also means longer processing time.*


#### Switching between sessions

Changing **any** parameter in the extraction panel and clicking on the "Update" or the "Extract" button will switch to another *session*. HappyFeat automatically detects if the new set of parameters has already been used before. If not, a new *session* is created (meaning a new entry in the *workspace*'s configuration file, and a new numbered folder in the file tree). Otherwise, all the info from the session is recovered and made available.

The "update" button switches to another (existing or new) session, without launching any extraction. This allows for example to quickly compare training results using different connectivity estimators (coherence vs. imaginary coherence), or using different AR model orders.

#### Avoiding redundant operations

When launching a "Feature Extraction" operation, HappyFeat automatically checks if the selected EEG signal files have already been processed 
using the parameter set of the current session. If it's the case, the user is asked if they want to renew the operation.
